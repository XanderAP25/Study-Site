## Generated Stories

Below is a CSV file containing the three sets of 63 stories (189 total) generated using the three different methods from my story generation code notebook, those being: a baseline pretrained model using zero-shot reasoning, a baseline pretrained model using ICL prompts, and a fine-tuned model. In the future, I might include some particularly interesting stories here so you don't have to download the full set of stories.

Spreadsheet software doesn't make for a great reading experience, so I would recommend pasting the story into a notepad application if you are going to read them.
