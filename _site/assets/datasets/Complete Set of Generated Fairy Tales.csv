There was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and
when she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that,
was quite happy and thought: ‘You certainly are a pretty girl!’ And when
she came home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught of wine,
and as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever she
was cooking until she was satisfied, and said: ‘The cook must know what
the food is like.’

It came to pass that the master one day said to her: ‘Gretel, there is a
guest coming this evening; prepare me two fowls very daintily.’ ‘I will
see to it, master,’ answered Gretel. She killed two fowls, scalded them,
plucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before
the fire, that they might roast. The fowls began to turn brown, and were
nearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived. Then Gretel called out
to her master: ‘If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away
from the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten
the moment they are at their juiciest.’ The master said: ‘I will run
myself, and fetch the guest.’ When the master had turned his back,
Gretel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and thought: ‘Standing
so long by the fire there, makes one sweat and thirsty; who knows
when they will come? Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a
drink.’ She ran down, set a jug, said: ‘God bless it for you, Gretel,’
and took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should
not be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught.

Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them,
and drove the spit merrily round. But as the roast meat smelt so good,
Gretel thought: ‘Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!’
She touched it with her finger, and said: ‘Ah! how good fowls are! It
certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right
time!’ She ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with
his guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the fowls and thought:
‘One of the wings is burning! I had better take it off and eat it.’
So she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she
thought: ‘The other must go down too, or else master will observe that
something is missing.’ When the two wings were eaten, she went and
looked for her master, and did not see him. It suddenly occurred to
her: ‘Who knows? They are perhaps not coming at all, and have turned in
somewhere.’ Then she said: ‘Well, Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has
been cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is
eaten you will have some peace, why should God’s good gifts be spoilt?’
So she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the
one chicken in great glee. When one of the chickens was swallowed down,
and still her master did not come, Gretel looked at the other and said:
‘What one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what’s
right for the one is right for the other; I think if I were to take
another draught it would do me no harm.’ So she took another hearty
drink, and let the second chicken follow the first.

While she was making the most of it, her master came and cried: ‘Hurry
up, Gretel, the guest is coming directly after me!’ ‘Yes, sir, I will
soon serve up,’ answered Gretel. Meantime the master looked to see that
the table was properly laid, and took the great knife, wherewith he was
going to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on the steps. Presently
the guest came, and knocked politely and courteously at the house-door.
Gretel ran, and looked to see who was there, and when she saw the guest,
she put her finger to her lips and said: ‘Hush! hush! go away as quickly
as you can, if my master catches you it will be the worse for you; he
certainly did ask you to supper, but his intention is to cut off your
two ears. Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!’ The guest
heard the sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he
could. Gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried:
‘You have invited a fine guest!’ ‘Why, Gretel? What do you mean by
that?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘he has taken the chickens which I was just
going to serve up, off the dish, and has run away with them!’ ‘That’s a
nice trick!’ said her master, and lamented the fine chickens. ‘If he had
but left me one, so that something remained for me to eat.’ He called to
him to stop, but the guest pretended not to hear. Then he ran after him
with the knife still in his hand, crying: ‘Just one, just one,’ meaning
that the guest should leave him just one chicken, and not take both. The
guest, however, thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of
his ears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take
them both with him.
‘Dear children,’ said a poor man to his four sons, ‘I have nothing to
give you; you must go out into the wide world and try your luck. Begin
by learning some craft or another, and see how you can get on.’ So the
four brothers took their walking-sticks in their hands, and their little
bundles on their shoulders, and after bidding their father goodbye, went
all out at the gate together. When they had got on some way they came
to four crossways, each leading to a different country. Then the eldest
said, ‘Here we must part; but this day four years we will come back
to this spot, and in the meantime each must try what he can do for
himself.’

So each brother went his way; and as the eldest was hastening on a man
met him, and asked him where he was going, and what he wanted. ‘I am
going to try my luck in the world, and should like to begin by learning
some art or trade,’ answered he. ‘Then,’ said the man, ‘go with me, and
I will teach you to become the cunningest thief that ever was.’ ‘No,’
said the other, ‘that is not an honest calling, and what can one look
to earn by it in the end but the gallows?’ ‘Oh!’ said the man, ‘you need
not fear the gallows; for I will only teach you to steal what will be
fair game: I meddle with nothing but what no one else can get or care
anything about, and where no one can find you out.’ So the young man
agreed to follow his trade, and he soon showed himself so clever, that
nothing could escape him that he had once set his mind upon.

The second brother also met a man, who, when he found out what he was
setting out upon, asked him what craft he meant to follow. ‘I do not
know yet,’ said he. ‘Then come with me, and be a star-gazer. It is a
noble art, for nothing can be hidden from you, when once you understand
the stars.’ The plan pleased him much, and he soon became such a skilful
star-gazer, that when he had served out his time, and wanted to leave
his master, he gave him a glass, and said, ‘With this you can see all
that is passing in the sky and on earth, and nothing can be hidden from
you.’

The third brother met a huntsman, who took him with him, and taught him
so well all that belonged to hunting, that he became very clever in the
craft of the woods; and when he left his master he gave him a bow, and
said, ‘Whatever you shoot at with this bow you will be sure to hit.’

The youngest brother likewise met a man who asked him what he wished to
do. ‘Would not you like,’ said he, ‘to be a tailor?’ ‘Oh, no!’ said
the young man; ‘sitting cross-legged from morning to night, working
backwards and forwards with a needle and goose, will never suit me.’
‘Oh!’ answered the man, ‘that is not my sort of tailoring; come with me,
and you will learn quite another kind of craft from that.’ Not knowing
what better to do, he came into the plan, and learnt tailoring from the
beginning; and when he left his master, he gave him a needle, and said,
‘You can sew anything with this, be it as soft as an egg or as hard as
steel; and the joint will be so fine that no seam will be seen.’

After the space of four years, at the time agreed upon, the four
brothers met at the four cross-roads; and having welcomed each other,
set off towards their father’s home, where they told him all that had
happened to them, and how each had learned some craft.

Then, one day, as they were sitting before the house under a very high
tree, the father said, ‘I should like to try what each of you can do in
this way.’ So he looked up, and said to the second son, ‘At the top of
this tree there is a chaffinch’s nest; tell me how many eggs there are
in it.’ The star-gazer took his glass, looked up, and said, ‘Five.’
‘Now,’ said the father to the eldest son, ‘take away the eggs without
letting the bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them know
anything of what you are doing.’ So the cunning thief climbed up the
tree, and brought away to his father the five eggs from under the bird;
and it never saw or felt what he was doing, but kept sitting on at its
ease. Then the father took the eggs, and put one on each corner of the
table, and the fifth in the middle, and said to the huntsman, ‘Cut all
the eggs in two pieces at one shot.’ The huntsman took up his bow, and
at one shot struck all the five eggs as his father wished.

‘Now comes your turn,’ said he to the young tailor; ‘sew the eggs and
the young birds in them together again, so neatly that the shot shall
have done them no harm.’ Then the tailor took his needle, and sewed the
eggs as he was told; and when he had done, the thief was sent to take
them back to the nest, and put them under the bird without its knowing
it. Then she went on sitting, and hatched them: and in a few days they
crawled out, and had only a little red streak across their necks, where
the tailor had sewn them together.

‘Well done, sons!’ said the old man; ‘you have made good use of your
time, and learnt something worth the knowing; but I am sure I do not
know which ought to have the prize. Oh, that a time might soon come for
you to turn your skill to some account!’

Not long after this there was a great bustle in the country; for the
king’s daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon, and the king
mourned over his loss day and night, and made it known that whoever
brought her back to him should have her for a wife. Then the four
brothers said to each other, ‘Here is a chance for us; let us try
what we can do.’ And they agreed to see whether they could not set the
princess free. ‘I will soon find out where she is, however,’ said the
star-gazer, as he looked through his glass; and he soon cried out, ‘I
see her afar off, sitting upon a rock in the sea, and I can spy the
dragon close by, guarding her.’ Then he went to the king, and asked for
a ship for himself and his brothers; and they sailed together over the
sea, till they came to the right place. There they found the princess
sitting, as the star-gazer had said, on the rock; and the dragon was
lying asleep, with his head upon her lap. ‘I dare not shoot at him,’
said the huntsman, ‘for I should kill the beautiful young lady also.’
‘Then I will try my skill,’ said the thief, and went and stole her away
from under the dragon, so quietly and gently that the beast did not know
it, but went on snoring.

Then away they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards the
ship; but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the air; for
he awoke and missed the princess. But when he got over the boat, and
wanted to pounce upon them and carry off the princess, the huntsman took
up his bow and shot him straight through the heart so that he fell down
dead. They were still not safe; for he was such a great beast that in
his fall he overset the boat, and they had to swim in the open sea
upon a few planks. So the tailor took his needle, and with a few large
stitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these,
and sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked
them together so quickly that the boat was soon ready, and they then
reached the ship and got home safe.

When they had brought home the princess to her father, there was great
rejoicing; and he said to the four brothers, ‘One of you shall marry
her, but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be.’ Then
there arose a quarrel between them; and the star-gazer said, ‘If I had
not found the princess out, all your skill would have been of no use;
therefore she ought to be mine.’ ‘Your seeing her would have been of
no use,’ said the thief, ‘if I had not taken her away from the dragon;
therefore she ought to be mine.’ ‘No, she is mine,’ said the huntsman;
‘for if I had not killed the dragon, he would, after all, have torn you
and the princess into pieces.’ ‘And if I had not sewn the boat together
again,’ said the tailor, ‘you would all have been drowned, therefore she
is mine.’ Then the king put in a word, and said, ‘Each of you is right;
and as all cannot have the young lady, the best way is for neither of
you to have her: for the truth is, there is somebody she likes a great
deal better. But to make up for your loss, I will give each of you, as a
reward for his skill, half a kingdom.’ So the brothers agreed that this
plan would be much better than either quarrelling or marrying a lady who
had no mind to have them. And the king then gave to each half a kingdom,
as he had said; and they lived very happily the rest of their days, and
took good care of their father; and somebody took better care of the
young lady, than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have
her again.

There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so
the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he
did spill a little of anything.

","There was once a baker named Hans, who wore boots with brown laces, and
when he walked out with them on, he turned himself this way and that,
was quite happy and thought: ‘You certainly are a hardworking man!’
And when he came home he kneaded, in his gladness of heart, the dough,
and as kneading excites a desire to eat, he tasted the best of whatever
he was baking until he was satisfied, and said: ‘The baker must know
what the bread is like.’

It came to pass that the owner one day said to him: ‘Hans, there is
an order for a large loaf of bread; bake it very well.’ ‘I will see to
it, master,’ answered Hans. He kneaded the dough, let it rise, shaped
it, and towards evening set it in the oven, that it might bake. The
bread began to brown, and was nearly ready, but the customer had not
yet arrived. Then Hans called out to his master: ‘If the customer does
not come, I must take the bread away from the oven, but it will be a
sin and a shame if it is not eaten the moment it is at its juiciest.’
The master said: ‘I will run myself, and fetch the customer.’ When the
master had turned his back, Hans laid the loaf on one side, and thought:
‘Standing so long by the oven there, makes one sweat and thirsty; who
knows when they will come? Meanwhile, I will run into the storeroom,
and take a drink.’ He ran down, set a jug, said: ‘God bless it for you,
Hans,’ and took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and
should not be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught.

Then he went and put the loaf down again to the oven, basted it, and
drove the spade merrily round. But as the bread smelt so good, Hans
thought: ‘Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!’ He touched
it with his finger, and said: ‘Ah! how good bread is! It certainly is a
sin and a shame that it is not eaten at the right time!’ He ran to the
window, to see if the master was not coming with his customer, but he
saw no one, and went back to the bread and thought: ‘One end is burning!
I had better take it off and eat it.’ So he cut it off, ate it, and
enjoyed it, and when he had done, he thought: ‘The other must go down too,
or else master will observe that something is missing.’ When the two ends
were eaten, he went and looked for his master, and did not see him. It
suddenly occurred to him: ‘Who knows? They are perhaps not coming at all,
and have turned in some other direction.’ Then he said: ‘Well, Hans,
enjoy yourself, one loaf has been cut into, take another drink, and eat
it up entirely; when it is eaten you will have some peace, why should
God’s good gifts be spoilt?’ So he ran into the storeroom again, took an
enormous drink, and let the one loaf follow the other.

Once in summer-time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest,
and the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said: ‘Brother
wolf, what bird is it that sings so well?’ ‘That is the King of birds,’
said the wolf, ‘before whom we must bow down.’ In reality the bird was
the willow-wren. ‘IF that’s the case,’ said the bear, ‘I should very
much like to see his royal palace; come, take me thither.’ ‘That is not
done quite as you seem to think,’ said the wolf; ‘you must wait until
the Queen comes,’ Soon afterwards, the Queen arrived with some food in
her beak, and the lord King came too, and they began to feed their young
ones. The bear would have liked to go at once, but the wolf held him
back by the sleeve, and said: ‘No, you must wait until the lord and lady
Queen have gone away again.’ So they took stock of the hole where the
nest lay, and trotted away. The bear, however, could not rest until he
had seen the royal palace, and when a short time had passed, went to it
again. The King and Queen had just flown out, so he peeped in and saw
five or six young ones lying there. ‘Is that the royal palace?’ cried
the bear; ‘it is a wretched palace, and you are not King’s children, you
are disreputable children!’ When the young wrens heard that, they were
frightfully angry, and screamed: ‘No, that we are not! Our parents are
honest people! Bear, you will have to pay for that!’

The bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their
holes. The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream, and
when their parents again brought food they said: ‘We will not so much as
touch one fly’s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have
settled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been
here and has insulted us!’ Then the old King said: ‘Be easy, he shall
be punished,’ and he at once flew with the Queen to the bear’s cave, and
called in: ‘Old Growler, why have you insulted my children? You shall
suffer for it--we will punish you by a bloody war.’ Thus war was
announced to the Bear, and all four-footed animals were summoned to take
part in it, oxen, asses, cows, deer, and every other animal the earth
contained. And the willow-wren summoned everything which flew in the
air, not only birds, large and small, but midges, and hornets, bees and
flies had to come.

When the time came for the war to begin, the willow-wren sent out spies
to discover who was the enemy’s commander-in-chief. The gnat, who was
the most crafty, flew into the forest where the enemy was assembled,
and hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the password was to be
announced. There stood the bear, and he called the fox before him
and said: ‘Fox, you are the most cunning of all animals, you shall be
general and lead us.’ ‘Good,’ said the fox, ‘but what signal shall we
agree upon?’ No one knew that, so the fox said: ‘I have a fine long
bushy tail, which almost looks like a plume of red feathers. When I lift
my tail up quite high, all is going well, and you must charge; but if I
let it hang down, run away as fast as you can.’ When the gnat had heard
that, she flew away again, and revealed everything, down to the minutest
detail, to the willow-wren. When day broke, and the battle was to begin,
all the four-footed animals came running up with such a noise that the
earth trembled. The willow-wren with his army also came flying through
the air with such a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one
was uneasy and afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each
other. But the willow-wren sent down the hornet, with orders to settle
beneath the fox’s tail, and sting with all his might. When the fox felt
the first string, he started so that he lifted one leg, from pain, but
he bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second
sting, he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could
hold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail between his legs. When
the animals saw that, they thought all was lost, and began to flee, each
into his hole, and the birds had won the battle.

Then the King and Queen flew home to their children and cried:
‘Children, rejoice, eat and drink to your heart’s content, we have won
the battle!’ But the young wrens said: ‘We will not eat yet, the bear
must come to the nest, and beg for pardon and say that we are honourable
children, before we will do that.’ Then the willow-wren flew to the
bear’s hole and cried: ‘Growler, you are to come to the nest to my
children, and beg their pardon, or else every rib of your body shall
be broken.’ So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear, and begged
their pardon. And now at last the young wrens were satisfied, and sat
down together and ate and drank, and made merry till quite late into the
night.
A shepherd’s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him
suffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he
took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood.
On the road he met a sparrow that said to him, ‘Why are you so sad,
my friend?’ ‘Because,’ said the dog, ‘I am very very hungry, and have
nothing to eat.’ ‘If that be all,’ answered the sparrow, ‘come with me
into the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.’ So on they
went together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher’s shop,
the sparrow said to the dog, ‘Stand there a little while till I peck you
down a piece of meat.’ So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having
first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she
pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf,
till at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up, and scrambled
away with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up. ‘Well,’ said
the sparrow, ‘you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to
the next shop, and I will peck you down another steak.’ When the dog had
eaten this too, the sparrow said to him, ‘Well, my good friend, have you
had enough now?’ ‘I have had plenty of meat,’ answered he, ‘but I should
like to have a piece of bread to eat after it.’ ‘Come with me then,’
said the sparrow, ‘and you shall soon have that too.’ So she took him
to a baker’s shop, and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window, till
they fell down: and as the dog still wished for more, she took him to
another shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten, the
sparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. ‘Yes,’ said he; ‘and
now let us take a walk a little way out of the town.’ So they both went
out upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone
far before the dog said, ‘I am very much tired--I should like to take a
nap.’ ‘Very well,’ answered the sparrow, ‘do so, and in the meantime
I will perch upon that bush.’ So the dog stretched himself out on the
road, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with
a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. The
sparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would
go on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called
out, ‘Stop! stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.’ But the
carter, grumbling to himself, ‘You make it the worse for me, indeed!
what can you do?’ cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor
dog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. ‘There,’ cried the
sparrow, ‘thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now
mind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.’
‘Do your worst, and welcome,’ said the brute, ‘what harm can you do me?’
and passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and
pecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and then
all the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it. At last he looked
round, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty.
‘What an unlucky wretch I am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said
the sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses, and
pecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the carter saw this,
he drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill
her; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horse’s head
with such force, that he fell down dead. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’
cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the sparrow. And as the carter
went on with the other two horses, she again crept under the tilt of the
cart, and pecked out the bung of the second cask, so that all the wine
ran out. When the carter saw this, he again cried out, ‘Miserable wretch
that I am!’ But the sparrow answered, ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ and
perched on the head of the second horse, and pecked at him too. The
carter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she
flew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the
spot. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ said he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said
the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him
too. The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or
caring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his
third horse as he done the other two. ‘Alas! miserable wretch that I
am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ answered the sparrow as she flew
away; ‘now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.’ The
carter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home
overflowing with rage and vexation. ‘Alas!’ said he to his wife, ‘what
ill luck has befallen me!--my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three
dead.’ ‘Alas! husband,’ replied she, ‘and a wicked bird has come into
the house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am
sure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it
up at such a rate!’ Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of
birds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the
midst of them. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ cried the carter; for he saw
that the corn was almost all gone. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the
sparrow; ‘thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life yet!’ and away she flew.

The carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down
into his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat
himself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow sat
on the outside of the window, and cried ‘Carter! thy cruelty shall cost
thee thy life!’ With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet,
and threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the
window. The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window-seat, and
cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!’ Then he became mad and
blind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he
cleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter
and his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture,
glasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without
touching the bird at all. In the end, however, they caught her: and the
wife said, ‘Shall I kill her at once?’ ‘No,’ cried he, ‘that is letting
her off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat
her.’ But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck
and cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!’ With that he
could wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, ‘Wife,
strike at the bird and kill her in my hand.’ And the wife struck; but
she missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down
dead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish
of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and
that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw.
When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her
observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards
a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw
began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?’ The coal
replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped
by sheer force, my death would have been certain,--I should have been
burnt to ashes.’ The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin,
but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made
into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.’ ‘And would a better
fate have fallen to my lot?’ said the straw. ‘The old woman has
destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at
once, and took their lives. I luckily slipped through her fingers.’

‘But what are we to do now?’ said the coal.

‘I think,’ answered the bean, ‘that as we have so fortunately escaped
death, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new
mischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and
repair to a foreign country.’

The proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way
together. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was
no bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over
it. The straw hit on a good idea, and said: ‘I will lay myself straight
across, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.’ The straw
therefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal,
who was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the
newly-built bridge. But when she had reached the middle, and heard the
water rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still,
and ventured no farther. The straw, however, began to burn, broke in
two pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed
when she got into the water, and breathed her last. The bean, who had
prudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event,
was unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst. It would
have been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who
was travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook.
As he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread,
and sewed her together. The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the
tailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam.

","Once upon a time, a cunning fox and a wise owl lived in the same forest. One day, they decided to challenge each other to a contest to prove who was the most clever. The owl proposed a riddle contest, while the fox suggested a game of wits. They agreed to meet at the old oak tree the following day to determine the winner.

The day arrived, and the forest animals gathered to witness the contest. The fox, full of confidence, boasted that he would easily outsmart the owl. The owl, however, remained calm and composed.

The contest began, and the owl presented the fox with a riddle: ""What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening?"" The fox, unable to answer, became flustered. The owl, satisfied with her question, presented the fox with a game of wits.

The game was simple: the fox had to cross a river without getting wet. The fox, using his cunning, spotted a hollow log floating in the river. He carefully climbed inside the log and paddled across the river, emerging dry on the other side. The owl, impressed, admitted that the fox had outsmarted her in the game of wits.

However, the fox had not anticipated the owl's next move. The owl, with a twinkle in her eye, presented the fox with another riddle: ""What has keys but can't open locks?"" The fox, stumped, pondered for a moment before realizing the answer: ""A piano."" The owl, pleased with the fox's quick thinking, declared the contest a tie.

From that day forward, the cunning fox and the wise owl remained friends, admiring each other's intelligence and wisdom. They continued to challenge each other, always learning something new from their encounters. And so, the forest animals lived happily, knowing that they had two of the cleverest animals in the land.

One day, a hunter came to the forest, intent on capturing the cunning fox. The owl, knowing the danger, warned the fox and devised a plan to save him. The owl led the hunter to a deep pit, pretending to be the fox. The hunter, thinking he had caught his prey, threw a net over the owl. The owl, however, had tied the net to a tree, and when the hunter pulled, the owl flew away, leaving the hunter with an empty net.

The cunning fox, grateful to the owl, promised to protect her from harm. And so, the cunning fox and the wise owl continued to live in the forest, always looking out for each other, and always ready to challenge each other with riddles and games of wits. The End."

A certain father had two sons, the elder of who was smart and sensible,
and could do everything, but the younger was stupid and could neither
learn nor understand anything, and when people saw him they said:
‘There’s a fellow who will give his father some trouble!’ When anything
had to be done, it was always the elder who was forced to do it; but
if his father bade him fetch anything when it was late, or in the
night-time, and the way led through the churchyard, or any other dismal
place, he answered: ‘Oh, no father, I’ll not go there, it makes me
shudder!’ for he was afraid. Or when stories were told by the fire at
night which made the flesh creep, the listeners sometimes said: ‘Oh,
it makes us shudder!’ The younger sat in a corner and listened with
the rest of them, and could not imagine what they could mean. ‘They are
always saying: “It makes me shudder, it makes me shudder!” It does not
make me shudder,’ thought he. ‘That, too, must be an art of which I
understand nothing!’

Now it came to pass that his father said to him one day: ‘Hearken to me,
you fellow in the corner there, you are growing tall and strong, and you
too must learn something by which you can earn your bread. Look how your
brother works, but you do not even earn your salt.’ ‘Well, father,’ he
replied, ‘I am quite willing to learn something--indeed, if it could but
be managed, I should like to learn how to shudder. I don’t understand
that at all yet.’ The elder brother smiled when he heard that, and
thought to himself: ‘Goodness, what a blockhead that brother of mine is!
He will never be good for anything as long as he lives! He who wants to
be a sickle must bend himself betimes.’

The father sighed, and answered him: ‘You shall soon learn what it is to
shudder, but you will not earn your bread by that.’

Soon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and the father
bewailed his trouble, and told him how his younger son was so backward
in every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing. ‘Just think,’
said he, ‘when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread, he
actually wanted to learn to shudder.’ ‘If that be all,’ replied the
sexton, ‘he can learn that with me. Send him to me, and I will soon
polish him.’ The father was glad to do it, for he thought: ‘It will
train the boy a little.’ The sexton therefore took him into his house,
and he had to ring the church bell. After a day or two, the sexton awoke
him at midnight, and bade him arise and go up into the church tower and
ring the bell. ‘You shall soon learn what shuddering is,’ thought he,
and secretly went there before him; and when the boy was at the top of
the tower and turned round, and was just going to take hold of the bell
rope, he saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite the sounding
hole. ‘Who is there?’ cried he, but the figure made no reply, and did
not move or stir. ‘Give an answer,’ cried the boy, ‘or take yourself
off, you have no business here at night.’

The sexton, however, remained standing motionless that the boy might
think he was a ghost. The boy cried a second time: ‘What do you want
here?--speak if you are an honest fellow, or I will throw you down the
steps!’ The sexton thought: ‘He can’t mean to be as bad as his words,’
uttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone. Then the boy
called to him for the third time, and as that was also to no purpose,
he ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs, so that it fell
down the ten steps and remained lying there in a corner. Thereupon he
rang the bell, went home, and without saying a word went to bed, and
fell asleep. The sexton’s wife waited a long time for her husband, but
he did not come back. At length she became uneasy, and wakened the boy,
and asked: ‘Do you know where my husband is? He climbed up the tower
before you did.’ ‘No, I don’t know,’ replied the boy, ‘but someone was
standing by the sounding hole on the other side of the steps, and as he
would neither give an answer nor go away, I took him for a scoundrel,
and threw him downstairs. Just go there and you will see if it was he.
I should be sorry if it were.’ The woman ran away and found her husband,
who was lying moaning in the corner, and had broken his leg.

She carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the
boy’s father, ‘Your boy,’ cried she, ‘has been the cause of a great
misfortune! He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke his
leg. Take the good-for-nothing fellow out of our house.’ The father was
terrified, and ran thither and scolded the boy. ‘What wicked tricks
are these?’ said he. ‘The devil must have put them into your head.’
‘Father,’ he replied, ‘do listen to me. I am quite innocent. He was
standing there by night like one intent on doing evil. I did not know
who it was, and I entreated him three times either to speak or to go
away.’ ‘Ah,’ said the father, ‘I have nothing but unhappiness with you.
Go out of my sight. I will see you no more.’

‘Yes, father, right willingly, wait only until it is day. Then will I
go forth and learn how to shudder, and then I shall, at any rate,
understand one art which will support me.’ ‘Learn what you will,’ spoke
the father, ‘it is all the same to me. Here are fifty talers for you.
Take these and go into the wide world, and tell no one from whence you
come, and who is your father, for I have reason to be ashamed of you.’
‘Yes, father, it shall be as you will. If you desire nothing more than
that, I can easily keep it in mind.’

When the day dawned, therefore, the boy put his fifty talers into his
pocket, and went forth on the great highway, and continually said to
himself: ‘If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!’ Then a man
approached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding with
himself, and when they had walked a little farther to where they could
see the gallows, the man said to him: ‘Look, there is the tree where
seven men have married the ropemaker’s daughter, and are now learning
how to fly. Sit down beneath it, and wait till night comes, and you will
soon learn how to shudder.’ ‘If that is all that is wanted,’ answered
the youth, ‘it is easily done; but if I learn how to shudder as fast as
that, you shall have my fifty talers. Just come back to me early in the
morning.’ Then the youth went to the gallows, sat down beneath it, and
waited till evening came. And as he was cold, he lighted himself a fire,
but at midnight the wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire, he
could not get warm. And as the wind knocked the hanged men against each
other, and they moved backwards and forwards, he thought to himself:
‘If you shiver below by the fire, how those up above must freeze and
suffer!’ And as he felt pity for them, he raised the ladder, and climbed
up, unbound one of them after the other, and brought down all seven.
Then he stoked the fire, blew it, and set them all round it to warm
themselves. But they sat there and did not stir, and the fire caught
their clothes. So he said: ‘Take care, or I will hang you up again.’ The
dead men, however, did not hear, but were quite silent, and let their
rags go on burning. At this he grew angry, and said: ‘If you will not
take care, I cannot help you, I will not be burnt with you,’ and he hung
them up again each in his turn. Then he sat down by his fire and fell
asleep, and the next morning the man came to him and wanted to have
the fifty talers, and said: ‘Well do you know how to shudder?’ ‘No,’
answered he, ‘how should I know? Those fellows up there did not open
their mouths, and were so stupid that they let the few old rags which
they had on their bodies get burnt.’ Then the man saw that he would not
get the fifty talers that day, and went away saying: ‘Such a youth has
never come my way before.’

The youth likewise went his way, and once more began to mutter to
himself: ‘Ah, if I could but shudder! Ah, if I could but shudder!’ A
waggoner who was striding behind him heard this and asked: ‘Who are
you?’ ‘I don’t know,’ answered the youth. Then the waggoner asked: ‘From
whence do you come?’ ‘I know not.’ ‘Who is your father?’ ‘That I may
not tell you.’ ‘What is it that you are always muttering between your
teeth?’ ‘Ah,’ replied the youth, ‘I do so wish I could shudder, but
no one can teach me how.’ ‘Enough of your foolish chatter,’ said the
waggoner. ‘Come, go with me, I will see about a place for you.’ The
youth went with the waggoner, and in the evening they arrived at an inn
where they wished to pass the night. Then at the entrance of the parlour
the youth again said quite loudly: ‘If I could but shudder! If I could
but shudder!’ The host who heard this, laughed and said: ‘If that is
your desire, there ought to be a good opportunity for you here.’ ‘Ah,
be silent,’ said the hostess, ‘so many prying persons have already lost
their lives, it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as
these should never see the daylight again.’

But the youth said: ‘However difficult it may be, I will learn it. For
this purpose indeed have I journeyed forth.’ He let the host have
no rest, until the latter told him, that not far from thence stood a
haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was,
if he would but watch in it for three nights. The king had promised that
he who would venture should have his daughter to wife, and she was the
most beautiful maiden the sun shone on. Likewise in the castle lay great
treasures, which were guarded by evil spirits, and these treasures would
then be freed, and would make a poor man rich enough. Already many men
had gone into the castle, but as yet none had come out again. Then the
youth went next morning to the king, and said: ‘If it be allowed, I will
willingly watch three nights in the haunted castle.’

The king looked at him, and as the youth pleased him, he said: ‘You may
ask for three things to take into the castle with you, but they must
be things without life.’ Then he answered: ‘Then I ask for a fire, a
turning lathe, and a cutting-board with the knife.’

The king had these things carried into the castle for him during the
day. When night was drawing near, the youth went up and made himself
a bright fire in one of the rooms, placed the cutting-board and knife
beside it, and seated himself by the turning-lathe. ‘Ah, if I could
but shudder!’ said he, ‘but I shall not learn it here either.’ Towards
midnight he was about to poke his fire, and as he was blowing it,
something cried suddenly from one corner: ‘Au, miau! how cold we are!’
‘You fools!’ cried he, ‘what are you crying about? If you are cold, come
and take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves.’ And when he had said
that, two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat down
on each side of him, and looked savagely at him with their fiery
eyes. After a short time, when they had warmed themselves, they said:
‘Comrade, shall we have a game of cards?’ ‘Why not?’ he replied, ‘but
just show me your paws.’ Then they stretched out their claws. ‘Oh,’ said
he, ‘what long nails you have! Wait, I must first cut them for you.’
Thereupon he seized them by the throats, put them on the cutting-board
and screwed their feet fast. ‘I have looked at your fingers,’ said he,
‘and my fancy for card-playing has gone,’ and he struck them dead and
threw them out into the water. But when he had made away with these two,
and was about to sit down again by his fire, out from every hole and
corner came black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains, and more
and more of them came until he could no longer move, and they yelled
horribly, and got on his fire, pulled it to pieces, and tried to put
it out. He watched them for a while quietly, but at last when they were
going too far, he seized his cutting-knife, and cried: ‘Away with you,
vermin,’ and began to cut them down. Some of them ran away, the others
he killed, and threw out into the fish-pond. When he came back he fanned
the embers of his fire again and warmed himself. And as he thus sat, his
eyes would keep open no longer, and he felt a desire to sleep. Then he
looked round and saw a great bed in the corner. ‘That is the very thing
for me,’ said he, and got into it. When he was just going to shut his
eyes, however, the bed began to move of its own accord, and went over
the whole of the castle. ‘That’s right,’ said he, ‘but go faster.’ Then
the bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it, up and down,
over thresholds and stairs, but suddenly hop, hop, it turned over upside
down, and lay on him like a mountain. But he threw quilts and pillows up
in the air, got out and said: ‘Now anyone who likes, may drive,’ and
lay down by his fire, and slept till it was day. In the morning the king
came, and when he saw him lying there on the ground, he thought the evil
spirits had killed him and he was dead. Then said he: ‘After all it is a
pity,--for so handsome a man.’ The youth heard it, got up, and said: ‘It
has not come to that yet.’ Then the king was astonished, but very glad,
and asked how he had fared. ‘Very well indeed,’ answered he; ‘one
night is past, the two others will pass likewise.’ Then he went to the
innkeeper, who opened his eyes very wide, and said: ‘I never expected to
see you alive again! Have you learnt how to shudder yet?’ ‘No,’ said he,
‘it is all in vain. If someone would but tell me!’

The second night he again went up into the old castle, sat down by the
fire, and once more began his old song: ‘If I could but shudder!’ When
midnight came, an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard; at
first it was low, but it grew louder and louder. Then it was quiet for
a while, and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down the
chimney and fell before him. ‘Hullo!’ cried he, ‘another half belongs
to this. This is not enough!’ Then the uproar began again, there was a
roaring and howling, and the other half fell down likewise. ‘Wait,’ said
he, ‘I will just stoke up the fire a little for you.’ When he had done
that and looked round again, the two pieces were joined together, and a
hideous man was sitting in his place. ‘That is no part of our bargain,’
said the youth, ‘the bench is mine.’ The man wanted to push him away;
the youth, however, would not allow that, but thrust him off with all
his strength, and seated himself again in his own place. Then still more
men fell down, one after the other; they brought nine dead men’s legs
and two skulls, and set them up and played at nine-pins with them. The
youth also wanted to play and said: ‘Listen you, can I join you?’ ‘Yes,
if you have any money.’ ‘Money enough,’ replied he, ‘but your balls are
not quite round.’ Then he took the skulls and put them in the lathe and
turned them till they were round. ‘There, now they will roll better!’
said he. ‘Hurrah! now we’ll have fun!’ He played with them and lost some
of his money, but when it struck twelve, everything vanished from his
sight. He lay down and quietly fell asleep. Next morning the king came
to inquire after him. ‘How has it fared with you this time?’ asked he.
‘I have been playing at nine-pins,’ he answered, ‘and have lost a couple
of farthings.’ ‘Have you not shuddered then?’ ‘What?’ said he, ‘I have
had a wonderful time! If I did but know what it was to shudder!’

The third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly:
‘If I could but shudder.’ When it grew late, six tall men came in and
brought a coffin. Then he said: ‘Ha, ha, that is certainly my little
cousin, who died only a few days ago,’ and he beckoned with his finger,
and cried: ‘Come, little cousin, come.’ They placed the coffin on the
ground, but he went to it and took the lid off, and a dead man lay
therein. He felt his face, but it was cold as ice. ‘Wait,’ said he, ‘I
will warm you a little,’ and went to the fire and warmed his hand and
laid it on the dead man’s face, but he remained cold. Then he took him
out, and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbed his
arms that the blood might circulate again. As this also did no good, he
thought to himself: ‘When two people lie in bed together, they warm each
other,’ and carried him to the bed, covered him over and lay down by
him. After a short time the dead man became warm too, and began to move.
Then said the youth, ‘See, little cousin, have I not warmed you?’ The
dead man, however, got up and cried: ‘Now will I strangle you.’

‘What!’ said he, ‘is that the way you thank me? You shall at once go
into your coffin again,’ and he took him up, threw him into it, and shut
the lid. Then came the six men and carried him away again. ‘I cannot
manage to shudder,’ said he. ‘I shall never learn it here as long as I
live.’

Then a man entered who was taller than all others, and looked terrible.
He was old, however, and had a long white beard. ‘You wretch,’ cried he,
‘you shall soon learn what it is to shudder, for you shall die.’ ‘Not so
fast,’ replied the youth. ‘If I am to die, I shall have to have a say
in it.’ ‘I will soon seize you,’ said the fiend. ‘Softly, softly, do not
talk so big. I am as strong as you are, and perhaps even stronger.’
‘We shall see,’ said the old man. ‘If you are stronger, I will let you
go--come, we will try.’ Then he led him by dark passages to a smith’s
forge, took an axe, and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground.
‘I can do better than that,’ said the youth, and went to the other
anvil. The old man placed himself near and wanted to look on, and his
white beard hung down. Then the youth seized the axe, split the anvil
with one blow, and in it caught the old man’s beard. ‘Now I have you,’
said the youth. ‘Now it is your turn to die.’ Then he seized an iron bar
and beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop, when he
would give him great riches. The youth drew out the axe and let him go.
The old man led him back into the castle, and in a cellar showed him
three chests full of gold. ‘Of these,’ said he, ‘one part is for the
poor, the other for the king, the third yours.’ In the meantime it
struck twelve, and the spirit disappeared, so that the youth stood in
darkness. ‘I shall still be able to find my way out,’ said he, and felt
about, found the way into the room, and slept there by his fire.
Next morning the king came and said: ‘Now you must have learnt what
shuddering is?’ ‘No,’ he answered; ‘what can it be? My dead cousin was
here, and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money down
below, but no one told me what it was to shudder.’ ‘Then,’ said the
king, ‘you have saved the castle, and shall marry my daughter.’ ‘That
is all very well,’ said he, ‘but still I do not know what it is to
shudder!’

Then the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated; but howsoever
much the young king loved his wife, and however happy he was, he still
said always: ‘If I could but shudder--if I could but shudder.’ And this
at last angered her. Her waiting-maid said: ‘I will find a cure for him;
he shall soon learn what it is to shudder.’ She went out to the stream
which flowed through the garden, and had a whole bucketful of gudgeons
brought to her. At night when the young king was sleeping, his wife was
to draw the clothes off him and empty the bucket full of cold water
with the gudgeons in it over him, so that the little fishes would
sprawl about him. Then he woke up and cried: ‘Oh, what makes me shudder
so?--what makes me shudder so, dear wife? Ah! now I know what it is to
shudder!’

","Once upon a time, there lived a poor farmer who had two sons. The elder son was hardworking and intelligent, while the younger son was lazy and foolish. The elder son did all the work on the farm, but the younger son only lazed about.

One day, the father said to the younger son, ""You must learn a trade, or you will never be able to support yourself.""

The younger son thought for a moment and said, ""I want to learn how to yawn. I don't understand why people do it, and I want to learn.""

The elder son laughed and said, ""You are a fool, brother. You will never amount to anything.""

The father sighed and said, ""Very well, I will take you to the town and find a teacher who can teach you how to yawn.""

The next day, they set off for the town. The father went to a wise old man who was known as the town's expert on yawning.

""I have a son who wants to learn how to yawn,"" the father said.

The old man looked at the younger son and said, ""Very well, I will teach him. But it will not be easy.""

The father agreed and left the younger son with the old man.

For a week, the younger son tried to learn how to yawn, but he could not. The old man grew frustrated and said, ""You are a fool, boy. I cannot teach you.""

The younger son was disappointed, but he did not give up. He went to the town square and asked people if they knew how to yawn. No one could teach him, and he grew more and more determined.

One night, as he was walking home, he heard a strange noise coming from a dark alley. He went to investigate and found a group of ghosts. They were yawning and stretching.

The younger son approached them and said, ""I want to learn how to yawn. Can you help me?""

The ghosts looked at him and said, ""We can teach you, but it will not be easy. You must come with us to our haunted castle and spend the night with us.""

The younger son agreed and followed the ghosts to the castle. They showed him a secret passage and told him to come back the next night.

That night, the younger son returned to the castle and spent the night with the ghosts. They taught him how to yawn, and he practiced until dawn.

The next day, he returned home and showed his father what he had learned. The father was amazed and proud of his son.

From that day on, the younger son could yawn at will. He showed off his new skill to everyone he met, and they were all impressed.

The elder son, however, was still jealous. He said, ""I could do that too if I wanted to.""

The younger son said, ""You could not. You are too lazy.""

The elder son worked hard to learn how to yawn, but he could not. He was always envious of his younger brother and his new skill.

One day, the elder son said, ""I will show you that I can yawn better than you.""

The younger son said, ""Very well, let us see.""

The elder son yawned and yawned, but he could not stop. He yawned so much that he fell to the ground and could not get up.

The younger son laughed and said, ""See, I can stop yawning whenever I want. You are a fool.""

The elder son was embarrassed and never tried to learn how to yawn again.

A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a tree
which bore golden apples. These apples were always counted, and about
the time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one
of them was gone. The king became very angry at this, and ordered the
gardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his
eldest son to watch; but about twelve o’clock he fell asleep, and in
the morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was
ordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning
another apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep watch; but
the gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come
to him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself
under the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling
noise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as
it was snapping at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener’s son
jumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm;
only it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then flew away.
The golden feather was brought to the king in the morning, and all the
council was called together. Everyone agreed that it was worth more than
all the wealth of the kingdom: but the king said, ‘One feather is of no
use to me, I must have the whole bird.’

Then the gardener’s eldest son set out and thought to find the golden
bird very easily; and when he had gone but a little way, he came to a
wood, and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting; so he took his
bow and made ready to shoot at it. Then the fox said, ‘Do not shoot me,
for I will give you good counsel; I know what your business is, and
that you want to find the golden bird. You will reach a village in the
evening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to each
other, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in
there, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you
to be very poor and mean.’ But the son thought to himself, ‘What can
such a beast as this know about the matter?’ So he shot his arrow at
the fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail above its back and
ran into the wood. Then he went his way, and in the evening came to
the village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people
singing, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked very dirty,
and poor. ‘I should be very silly,’ said he, ‘if I went to that shabby
house, and left this charming place’; so he went into the smart house,
and ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the bird, and his country too.

Time passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no tidings
were heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing happened
to him. He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but when he came
to the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the window where
the merrymaking was, and called to him to come in; and he could not
withstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden bird and
his country in the same manner.

Time passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set out into
the wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not
listen to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and
was afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent his
coming back. However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he would
not rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox, and heard
the same good counsel. But he was thankful to the fox, and did not
attempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said, ‘Sit upon my
tail, and you will travel faster.’ So he sat down, and the fox began to
run, and away they went over stock and stone so quick that their hair
whistled in the wind.

When they came to the village, the son followed the fox’s counsel, and
without looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all
night at his ease. In the morning came the fox again and met him as he
was beginning his journey, and said, ‘Go straight forward, till you come
to a castle, before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep and
snoring: take no notice of them, but go into the castle and pass on and
on till you come to a room, where the golden bird sits in a wooden cage;
close by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but do not try to take the
bird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one, otherwise
you will repent it.’ Then the fox stretched out his tail again, and the
young man sat himself down, and away they went over stock and stone till
their hair whistled in the wind.

Before the castle gate all was as the fox had said: so the son went in
and found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage, and
below stood the golden cage, and the three golden apples that had been
lost were lying close by it. Then thought he to himself, ‘It will be a
very droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cage’; so
he opened the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden cage.
But the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke, and
they took him prisoner and carried him before the king. The next morning
the court sat to judge him; and when all was heard, it sentenced him to
die, unless he should bring the king the golden horse which could run as
swiftly as the wind; and if he did this, he was to have the golden bird
given him for his own.

So he set out once more on his journey, sighing, and in great despair,
when on a sudden his friend the fox met him, and said, ‘You see now
what has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel. I will
still, however, tell you how to find the golden horse, if you will do as
I bid you. You must go straight on till you come to the castle where the
horse stands in his stall: by his side will lie the groom fast asleep
and snoring: take away the horse quietly, but be sure to put the old
leathern saddle upon him, and not the golden one that is close by it.’
Then the son sat down on the fox’s tail, and away they went over stock
and stone till their hair whistled in the wind.

All went right, and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the golden
saddle. But when the son looked at the horse, he thought it a great pity
to put the leathern saddle upon it. ‘I will give him the good one,’
said he; ‘I am sure he deserves it.’ As he took up the golden saddle the
groom awoke and cried out so loud, that all the guards ran in and took
him prisoner, and in the morning he was again brought before the court
to be judged, and was sentenced to die. But it was agreed, that, if he
could bring thither the beautiful princess, he should live, and have the
bird and the horse given him for his own.

Then he went his way very sorrowful; but the old fox came and said, ‘Why
did not you listen to me? If you had, you would have carried away
both the bird and the horse; yet will I once more give you counsel. Go
straight on, and in the evening you will arrive at a castle. At twelve
o’clock at night the princess goes to the bathing-house: go up to her
and give her a kiss, and she will let you lead her away; but take care
you do not suffer her to go and take leave of her father and mother.’
Then the fox stretched out his tail, and so away they went over stock
and stone till their hair whistled again.

As they came to the castle, all was as the fox had said, and at twelve
o’clock the young man met the princess going to the bath and gave her the
kiss, and she agreed to run away with him, but begged with many tears
that he would let her take leave of her father. At first he refused,
but she wept still more and more, and fell at his feet, till at last
he consented; but the moment she came to her father’s house the guards
awoke and he was taken prisoner again.

Then he was brought before the king, and the king said, ‘You shall never
have my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill that stops
the view from my window.’ Now this hill was so big that the whole world
could not take it away: and when he had worked for seven days, and had
done very little, the fox came and said. ‘Lie down and go to sleep; I
will work for you.’ And in the morning he awoke and the hill was gone;
so he went merrily to the king, and told him that now that it was
removed he must give him the princess.

Then the king was obliged to keep his word, and away went the young man
and the princess; and the fox came and said to him, ‘We will have all
three, the princess, the horse, and the bird.’ ‘Ah!’ said the young man,
‘that would be a great thing, but how can you contrive it?’

‘If you will only listen,’ said the fox, ‘it can be done. When you come
to the king, and he asks for the beautiful princess, you must say, “Here
she is!” Then he will be very joyful; and you will mount the golden
horse that they are to give you, and put out your hand to take leave of
them; but shake hands with the princess last. Then lift her quickly on
to the horse behind you; clap your spurs to his side, and gallop away as
fast as you can.’

All went right: then the fox said, ‘When you come to the castle where
the bird is, I will stay with the princess at the door, and you will
ride in and speak to the king; and when he sees that it is the right
horse, he will bring out the bird; but you must sit still, and say that
you want to look at it, to see whether it is the true golden bird; and
when you get it into your hand, ride away.’

This, too, happened as the fox said; they carried off the bird, the
princess mounted again, and they rode on to a great wood. Then the fox
came, and said, ‘Pray kill me, and cut off my head and my feet.’ But the
young man refused to do it: so the fox said, ‘I will at any rate give
you good counsel: beware of two things; ransom no one from the gallows,
and sit down by the side of no river.’ Then away he went. ‘Well,’
thought the young man, ‘it is no hard matter to keep that advice.’

He rode on with the princess, till at last he came to the village where
he had left his two brothers. And there he heard a great noise and
uproar; and when he asked what was the matter, the people said, ‘Two men
are going to be hanged.’ As he came nearer, he saw that the two men were
his brothers, who had turned robbers; so he said, ‘Cannot they in any
way be saved?’ But the people said ‘No,’ unless he would bestow all his
money upon the rascals and buy their liberty. Then he did not stay to
think about the matter, but paid what was asked, and his brothers were
given up, and went on with him towards their home.

And as they came to the wood where the fox first met them, it was so
cool and pleasant that the two brothers said, ‘Let us sit down by the
side of the river, and rest a while, to eat and drink.’ So he said,
‘Yes,’ and forgot the fox’s counsel, and sat down on the side of the
river; and while he suspected nothing, they came behind, and threw him
down the bank, and took the princess, the horse, and the bird, and went
home to the king their master, and said. ‘All this have we won by our
labour.’ Then there was great rejoicing made; but the horse would not
eat, the bird would not sing, and the princess wept.

The youngest son fell to the bottom of the river’s bed: luckily it was
nearly dry, but his bones were almost broken, and the bank was so steep
that he could find no way to get out. Then the old fox came once more,
and scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise no evil would
have befallen him: ‘Yet,’ said he, ‘I cannot leave you here, so lay hold
of my tail and hold fast.’ Then he pulled him out of the river, and said
to him, as he got upon the bank, ‘Your brothers have set watch to kill
you, if they find you in the kingdom.’ So he dressed himself as a poor
man, and came secretly to the king’s court, and was scarcely within the
doors when the horse began to eat, and the bird to sing, and the princess
left off weeping. Then he went to the king, and told him all his
brothers’ roguery; and they were seized and punished, and he had the
princess given to him again; and after the king’s death he was heir to
his kingdom.

A long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the old fox
met him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him, and cut
off his head and feet. And at last he did so, and in a moment the
fox was changed into a man, and turned out to be the brother of the
princess, who had been lost a great many many years.
There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so
the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he
did spill a little of anything.

","In a kingdom far away, there lived a king who had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a tree that bore golden pears. These pears were always counted, and it was discovered that every night one of them was missing. The king became very angry and ordered the gardener to keep watch under the tree. The gardener set his eldest son to watch, but he fell asleep, and in the morning another pear was missing.

There was once a king, whose queen had hair of the purest gold, and was
so beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole face of
the earth. But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she felt that her
end drew near she called the king to her and said, ‘Promise me that you
will never marry again, unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful
as I am, and who has golden hair like mine.’ Then when the king in his
grief promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died. But the king
was not to be comforted, and for a long time never thought of taking
another wife. At last, however, his wise men said, ‘this will not do;
the king must marry again, that we may have a queen.’ So messengers were
sent far and wide, to seek for a bride as beautiful as the late queen.
But there was no princess in the world so beautiful; and if there had
been, still there was not one to be found who had golden hair. So the
messengers came home, and had had all their trouble for nothing.

Now the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother,
and had the same golden hair. And when she was grown up, the king looked
at her and saw that she was just like this late queen: then he said to
his courtiers, ‘May I not marry my daughter? She is the very image of my
dead wife: unless I have her, I shall not find any bride upon the whole
earth, and you say there must be a queen.’ When the courtiers heard this
they were shocked, and said, ‘Heaven forbid that a father should marry
his daughter! Out of so great a sin no good can come.’ And his daughter
was also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts;
so she said to him, ‘Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses:
one must be of gold, like the sun; another must be of shining silver,
like the moon; and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this,
I want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to
which every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin.’ And thus
she thought he would think of the matter no more. But the king made the
most skilful workmen in his kingdom weave the three dresses: one golden,
like the sun; another silvery, like the moon; and a third sparkling,
like the stars: and his hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in
his kingdom, and to take the finest fur out of their skins: and thus a
mantle of a thousand furs was made.

When all were ready, the king sent them to her; but she got up in the
night when all were asleep, and took three of her trinkets, a golden
ring, a golden necklace, and a golden brooch, and packed the three
dresses--of the sun, the moon, and the stars--up in a nutshell, and
wrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur, and besmeared
her face and hands with soot. Then she threw herself upon Heaven for
help in her need, and went away, and journeyed on the whole night, till
at last she came to a large wood. As she was very tired, she sat herself
down in the hollow of a tree and soon fell asleep: and there she slept
on till it was midday.

Now as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it, his dogs
came to the tree, and began to snuff about, and run round and round, and
bark. ‘Look sharp!’ said the king to the huntsmen, ‘and see what sort
of game lies there.’ And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and when they
came back again said, ‘In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful
beast, such as we never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand
kinds of fur, but there it lies fast asleep.’ ‘See,’ said the king, ‘if
you can catch it alive, and we will take it with us.’ So the huntsmen
took it up, and the maiden awoke and was greatly frightened, and said,
‘I am a poor child that has neither father nor mother left; have pity on
me and take me with you.’ Then they said, ‘Yes, Miss Cat-skin, you will
do for the kitchen; you can sweep up the ashes, and do things of that
sort.’ So they put her into the coach, and took her home to the king’s
palace. Then they showed her a little corner under the staircase, where
no light of day ever peeped in, and said, ‘Cat-skin, you may lie and
sleep there.’ And she was sent into the kitchen, and made to fetch wood
and water, to blow the fire, pluck the poultry, pick the herbs, sift the
ashes, and do all the dirty work.

Thus Cat-skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully. ‘Ah! pretty
princess!’ thought she, ‘what will now become of thee?’ But it happened
one day that a feast was to be held in the king’s castle, so she said to
the cook, ‘May I go up a little while and see what is going on? I will
take care and stand behind the door.’ And the cook said, ‘Yes, you may
go, but be back again in half an hour’s time, to rake out the ashes.’
Then she took her little lamp, and went into her cabin, and took off the
fur skin, and washed the soot from off her face and hands, so that her
beauty shone forth like the sun from behind the clouds. She next opened
her nutshell, and brought out of it the dress that shone like the sun,
and so went to the feast. Everyone made way for her, for nobody knew
her, and they thought she could be no less than a king’s daughter. But
the king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and
he thought in his heart, ‘I never saw any one half so beautiful.’

When the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked
round for her, she was gone, no one knew wither. The guards that stood
at the castle gate were called in: but they had seen no one. The truth
was, that she had run into her little cabin, pulled off her dress,
blackened her face and hands, put on the fur-skin cloak, and was
Cat-skin again. When she went into the kitchen to her work, and began
to rake the ashes, the cook said, ‘Let that alone till the morning, and
heat the king’s soup; I should like to run up now and give a peep: but
take care you don’t let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of
never eating again.’

As soon as the cook went away, Cat-skin heated the king’s soup, and
toasted a slice of bread first, as nicely as ever she could; and when it
was ready, she went and looked in the cabin for her little golden ring,
and put it into the dish in which the soup was. When the dance was over,
the king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well,
that he thought he had never tasted any so good before. At the bottom
he saw a gold ring lying; and as he could not make out how it had got
there, he ordered the cook to be sent for. The cook was frightened when
he heard the order, and said to Cat-skin, ‘You must have let a hair fall
into the soup; if it be so, you will have a good beating.’ Then he went
before the king, and he asked him who had cooked the soup. ‘I did,’
answered the cook. But the king said, ‘That is not true; it was better
done than you could do it.’ Then he answered, ‘To tell the truth I did
not cook it, but Cat-skin did.’ ‘Then let Cat-skin come up,’ said the
king: and when she came he said to her, ‘Who are you?’ ‘I am a poor
child,’ said she, ‘that has lost both father and mother.’ ‘How came you
in my palace?’ asked he. ‘I am good for nothing,’ said she, ‘but to be
scullion-girl, and to have boots and shoes thrown at my head.’ ‘But how
did you get the ring that was in the soup?’ asked the king. Then she
would not own that she knew anything about the ring; so the king sent
her away again about her business.

After a time there was another feast, and Cat-skin asked the cook to let
her go up and see it as before. ‘Yes,’ said he, ‘but come again in half
an hour, and cook the king the soup that he likes so much.’ Then she
ran to her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her dress
out which was silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she went in,
looking like a king’s daughter, the king went up to her, and rejoiced at
seeing her again, and when the dance began he danced with her. After the
dance was at an end she managed to slip out, so slyly that the king did
not see where she was gone; but she sprang into her little cabin, and
made herself into Cat-skin again, and went into the kitchen to cook the
soup. Whilst the cook was above stairs, she got the golden necklace and
dropped it into the soup; then it was brought to the king, who ate it,
and it pleased him as well as before; so he sent for the cook, who
was again forced to tell him that Cat-skin had cooked it. Cat-skin was
brought again before the king, but she still told him that she was only
fit to have boots and shoes thrown at her head.

But when the king had ordered a feast to be got ready for the third
time, it happened just the same as before. ‘You must be a witch,
Cat-skin,’ said the cook; ‘for you always put something into your soup,
so that it pleases the king better than mine.’ However, he let her go up
as before. Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars, and
went into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again, and
thought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then. So whilst
he was dancing with her, he put a gold ring on her finger without her
seeing it, and ordered that the dance should be kept up a long time.
When it was at an end, he would have held her fast by the hand, but she
slipped away, and sprang so quickly through the crowd that he lost sight
of her: and she ran as fast as she could into her little cabin under
the stairs. But this time she kept away too long, and stayed beyond the
half-hour; so she had not time to take off her fine dress, and threw her
fur mantle over it, and in her haste did not blacken herself all over
with soot, but left one of her fingers white.

Then she ran into the kitchen, and cooked the king’s soup; and as soon
as the cook was gone, she put the golden brooch into the dish. When the
king got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and
soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst
they were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and
when she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off
a little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.

Then he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and
beautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so she
washed the soot and ashes from her face, and showed herself to be the
most beautiful princess upon the face of the earth. But the king said,
‘You are my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each
other.’ And the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as ever
was heard of or seen in that country, or indeed in any other.
It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to
herself: ‘He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the
world,’ she spoke to him in a friendly way. ‘Good day, dear Mr Fox,
how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard
times?’ The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from
head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give
any answer or not. At last he said: ‘Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you
piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have
you the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How
many arts do you understand?’ ‘I understand but one,’ replied the
cat, modestly. ‘What art is that?’ asked the fox. ‘When the hounds are
following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.’ ‘Is that all?’
said the fox. ‘I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain
a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will
teach you how people get away from the hounds.’ Just then came a hunter
with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top
of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. ‘Open your
sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,’ cried the cat to him, but the dogs had
already seized him, and were holding him fast. ‘Ah, Mr Fox,’ cried the
cat. ‘You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been
able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.’

There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so
the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he
did spill a little of anything.

Now, tell a single original traditional German folktale based on the structure and style above. Do not generate multiple stories. Only one  story should be created, and it should follow the same narrative structure as the examples above. Conclude the story with 'The End.'

","There was once a king, whose queen had hair as black as the raven's wing, and was so beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole face of the earth. But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she felt that her end drew near she called the king to her and said, ‘Promise me that you will never marry again, unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful as I am, and who has black hair like mine.’ Then when the king in his grief promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died. But the king was not to be comforted, and for a long time never thought of taking another wife. At last, however, his wise men said, ‘this will not do; the king must marry again, that we may have a queen.’ So messengers were sent far and wide, to seek for a bride as beautiful as the late queen. But there was no princess in the world so beautiful; and if there had been, still there was not one to be found who had black hair. So the messengers came home, and had had all their trouble for nothing.

Now the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same black hair. And when she was grown up, the king looked at her and saw that she was just like this late queen: then he said to his courtiers, ‘May I not marry my daughter? She is the very image of my dead wife: unless I have her, I shall not find any bride upon the whole earth, and you say there must be a queen.’ When the courtiers heard this they were shocked, and said, ‘Heaven forbid that a father should marry his daughter! Out of so great a sin no good can come.’ And his daughter was also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts; so she said to him, ‘Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses: one must be of silver, like the moon; another must be of shining gold, like the sun; and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this, I want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to which every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin.’ And thus she thought he would think of the matter no more. But the king made the most skilful workmen in his kingdom weave the three dresses: one silvery, like the moon; another golden, like the sun; and a third sparkling, like the stars: and his hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in his kingdom, and to take the finest fur out of their skins: and thus a mantle of a thousand furs was made.

When all were ready, the king sent them to her; but she got up in the night when all were asleep, and took three of her trinkets, a silver ring, a silver necklace, and a silver brooch, and packed the three dresses--of the moon, the sun, and the stars--up in a nutshell, and wrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur, and besmeared her face and hands with soot. Then she threw herself upon Heaven for help in her need, and went away, and journeyed on the whole night, till at last she came to a large wood. As she was very tired, she sat herself down in the hollow of a tree and soon fell asleep: and there she slept on till it was midday.

Now as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it, his dogs came to the tree, and began to snuff about, and run round and round, and bark. ‘Look sharp!’ said the king to the huntsmen, ‘and see what sort of game lies there.’ And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and when they came back again said, ‘In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful beast, such as we never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand kinds of fur, but there it lies fast asleep.’ ‘See,’ said the king, ‘if you can catch it alive, and we will take it with us.’ So the huntsmen took it up, and the maiden awoke and was greatly frightened, and said, ‘I am a poor child that has neither father nor mother.’ Have pity on me and take me with you.’ Then they said, ‘Yes, Miss Cat-skin, you will do for the kitchen; you can sweep up the ashes, and do things of that sort.’ So they put her into the coach, and took her home to the king’s palace. Then they showed her a little corner under the staircase, where no light of day ever peeped in, and said, ‘Cat-skin, you may lie and sleep there.’ And she was sent into the kitchen, and made to fetch wood and water, to blow the fire, pluck the poultry, pick the herbs, sift the ashes, and do all the dirty work.

Thus Cat-skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully. ‘Ah! pretty princess!’ thought she, ‘what will now become of thee?’ But it happened one day that a feast was to be held in the king’s castle, so she said to the cook, ‘May I go up a little while and see what is going on? I will take care and stand behind the door.’ And the cook said, ‘Yes, you may go, but be back again in half an hour’s time, to rake out the ashes.’ Then she took her little lamp, and went into her cabin, and took off the fur skin, and washed the soot from off her face and hands, so that her beauty shone forth like the sun from behind the clouds. She next opened her nutshell, and brought out of it the dress that shone like the sun, and so went to the feast. Everyone made way for her, for nobody knew her, and they thought she could be no less than a king’s daughter. But the king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and he thought in his heart, ‘I never saw any one half so beautiful.’

When the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked round for her, she was gone, no one knew wither. The guards that stood at the castle gate were called in: but they had seen no one. The truth was, that she had run into her little cabin, pulled off her dress, blackened her face and hands, put on the fur-skin cloak, and was Cat-skin again. When she went into the kitchen to her work, and began to rake the ashes, the cook said, ‘Let that alone till the morning, and heat the king’s soup; I should like to run up now and give a peep: but take care you don’t let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of never eating again.’

As soon as the cook went away, Cat-skin heated the king’s soup, and toasted a slice of bread first, as nicely as ever she could; and when it was ready, she went and looked in the cabin for her little silver ring, and put it into the dish in which the soup was. When the dance was over, the king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well, that he thought he had never tasted any so good before. At the bottom he saw a silver ring lying; and as he could not make out how it had got there, he ordered the cook to be sent for. The cook was frightened when he heard the order, and said to Cat-skin, ‘You must have let a hair fall into the soup; if it be so, you will have a good beating.’ Then he went before the king, and he asked him who had cooked the soup. ‘I did,’ answered the cook. But the king said, ‘That is not true; it was better done than you could do it.’ Then he answered, ‘To tell the truth I did not cook it, but Cat-skin did.’ ‘Then let Cat-skin come up,’ said the king: and when she came he said to her, ‘Who are you?’ ‘I am a poor child,’ said she, ‘that has lost both father and mother.’ ‘How came you in my palace?"

There was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie. And
when she had grown up her father said: ‘We will get her married.’ ‘Yes,’
said the mother, ‘if only someone would come who would have her.’ At
length a man came from a distance and wooed her, who was called Hans;
but he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really smart. ‘Oh,’ said
the father, ‘she has plenty of good sense’; and the mother said: ‘Oh,
she can see the wind coming up the street, and hear the flies coughing.’
‘Well,’ said Hans, ‘if she is not really smart, I won’t have her.’ When
they were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said: ‘Elsie, go
into the cellar and fetch some beer.’ Then Clever Elsie took the pitcher
from the wall, went into the cellar, and tapped the lid briskly as she
went, so that the time might not appear long. When she was below she
fetched herself a chair, and set it before the barrel so that she had
no need to stoop, and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected
injury. Then she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and
while the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle, but
looked up at the wall, and after much peering here and there, saw a
pick-axe exactly above her, which the masons had accidentally left
there.

Then Clever Elsie began to weep and said: ‘If I get Hans, and we have
a child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to draw
beer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then she
sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the
misfortune which lay before her. Those upstairs waited for the drink,
but Clever Elsie still did not come. Then the woman said to the servant:
‘Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is.’ The maid went and
found her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly. ‘Elsie why
do you weep?’ asked the maid. ‘Ah,’ she answered, ‘have I not reason to
weep? If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to
draw beer here, the pick-axe will perhaps fall on his head, and kill
him.’ Then said the maid: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down
beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune. After a while,
as the maid did not come back, and those upstairs were thirsty for the
beer, the man said to the boy: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see
where Elsie and the girl are.’ The boy went down, and there sat Clever
Elsie and the girl both weeping together. Then he asked: ‘Why are you
weeping?’ ‘Ah,’ said Elsie, ‘have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans,
and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the
pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then said the boy: ‘What
a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down by her, and likewise began to
howl loudly. Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he still did not
return, the man said to the woman: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see
where Elsie is!’ The woman went down, and found all three in the midst
of their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then Elsie told
her also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it
grew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down. Then said the
mother likewise: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down and wept
with them. The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not
come back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said: ‘I must go into the
cellar myself and see where Elsie is.’ But when he got into the cellar,
and they were all sitting together crying, and he heard the reason, and
that Elsie’s child was the cause, and the Elsie might perhaps bring one
into the world some day, and that he might be killed by the pick-axe, if
he should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very
time when it fell down, he cried: ‘Oh, what a clever Elsie!’ and sat
down, and likewise wept with them. The bridegroom stayed upstairs alone
for a long time; then as no one would come back he thought: ‘They must be
waiting for me below: I too must go there and see what they are about.’
When he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting
quite piteously, each out-doing the other. ‘What misfortune has happened
then?’ asked he. ‘Ah, dear Hans,’ said Elsie, ‘if we marry each other
and have a child, and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw
something to drink, then the pick-axe which has been left up there might
dash his brains out if it were to fall down, so have we not reason to
weep?’ ‘Come,’ said Hans, ‘more understanding than that is not needed
for my household, as you are such a clever Elsie, I will have you,’ and
seized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her.

After Hans had had her some time, he said: ‘Wife, I am going out to work
and earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the corn that we
may have some bread.’ ‘Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.’ After Hans had
gone away, she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field
with her. When she came to the field she said to herself: ‘What shall I
do; shall I cut first, or shall I eat first? Oh, I will eat first.’ Then
she drank her cup of broth and when she was fully satisfied, she once
more said: ‘What shall I do? Shall I cut first, or shall I sleep first?
I will sleep first.’ Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep.
Hans had been at home for a long time, but Elsie did not come; then said
he: ‘What a clever Elsie I have; she is so industrious that she does not
even come home to eat.’ But when evening came and she still stayed away,
Hans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she
was lying among the corn asleep. Then Hans hastened home and brought
a fowler’s net with little bells and hung it round about her, and she
still went on sleeping. Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat
down in his chair and worked. At length, when it was quite dark, Clever
Elsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about
her, and the bells rang at each step which she took. Then she was
alarmed, and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie or
not, and said: ‘Is it I, or is it not I?’ But she knew not what answer
to make to this, and stood for a time in doubt; at length she thought:
‘I will go home and ask if it be I, or if it be not I, they will be sure
to know.’ She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut; then
she knocked at the window and cried: ‘Hans, is Elsie within?’ ‘Yes,’
answered Hans, ‘she is within.’ Hereupon she was terrified, and said:
‘Ah, heavens! Then it is not I,’ and went to another door; but when the
people heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it, and she
could get in nowhere. Then she ran out of the village, and no one has
seen her since.
A shepherd’s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him
suffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he
took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood.
On the road he met a sparrow that said to him, ‘Why are you so sad,
my friend?’ ‘Because,’ said the dog, ‘I am very very hungry, and have
nothing to eat.’ ‘If that be all,’ answered the sparrow, ‘come with me
into the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.’ So on they
went together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher’s shop,
the sparrow said to the dog, ‘Stand there a little while till I peck you
down a piece of meat.’ So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having
first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she
pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf,
till at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up, and scrambled
away with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up. ‘Well,’ said
the sparrow, ‘you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to
the next shop, and I will peck you down another steak.’ When the dog had
eaten this too, the sparrow said to him, ‘Well, my good friend, have you
had enough now?’ ‘I have had plenty of meat,’ answered he, ‘but I should
like to have a piece of bread to eat after it.’ ‘Come with me then,’
said the sparrow, ‘and you shall soon have that too.’ So she took him
to a baker’s shop, and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window, till
they fell down: and as the dog still wished for more, she took him to
another shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten, the
sparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. ‘Yes,’ said he; ‘and
now let us take a walk a little way out of the town.’ So they both went
out upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone
far before the dog said, ‘I am very much tired--I should like to take a
nap.’ ‘Very well,’ answered the sparrow, ‘do so, and in the meantime
I will perch upon that bush.’ So the dog stretched himself out on the
road, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with
a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. The
sparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would
go on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called
out, ‘Stop! stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.’ But the
carter, grumbling to himself, ‘You make it the worse for me, indeed!
what can you do?’ cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor
dog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. ‘There,’ cried the
sparrow, ‘thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now
mind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.’
‘Do your worst, and welcome,’ said the brute, ‘what harm can you do me?’
and passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and
pecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and then
all the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it. At last he looked
round, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty.
‘What an unlucky wretch I am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said
the sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses, and
pecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the carter saw this,
he drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill
her; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horse’s head
with such force, that he fell down dead. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’
cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the sparrow. And as the carter
went on with the other two horses, she again crept under the tilt of the
cart, and pecked out the bung of the second cask, so that all the wine
ran out. When the carter saw this, he again cried out, ‘Miserable wretch
that I am!’ But the sparrow answered, ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ and
perched on the head of the second horse, and pecked at him too. The
carter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she
flew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the
spot. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ said he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said
the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him
too. The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or
caring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his
third horse as he done the other two. ‘Alas! miserable wretch that I
am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ answered the sparrow as she flew
away; ‘now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.’ The
carter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home
overflowing with rage and vexation. ‘Alas!’ said he to his wife, ‘what
ill luck has befallen me!--my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three
dead.’ ‘Alas! husband,’ replied she, ‘and a wicked bird has come into
the house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am
sure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it
up at such a rate!’ Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of
birds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the
midst of them. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ cried the carter; for he saw
that the corn was almost all gone. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the
sparrow; ‘thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life yet!’ and away she flew.

The carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down
into his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat
himself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow sat
on the outside of the window, and cried ‘Carter! thy cruelty shall cost
thee thy life!’ With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet,
and threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the
window. The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window-seat, and
cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!’ Then he became mad and
blind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he
cleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter
and his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture,
glasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without
touching the bird at all. In the end, however, they caught her: and the
wife said, ‘Shall I kill her at once?’ ‘No,’ cried he, ‘that is letting
her off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat
her.’ But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck
and cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!’ With that he
could wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, ‘Wife,
strike at the bird and kill her in my hand.’ And the wife struck; but
she missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down
dead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.

","Once upon a time, there was a man who had a daughter named Agnes. When she grew up, her father said, ""We will find her a husband."" ""Only if he is truly kind,"" said her mother. ""Oh, she will be fine with anyone,"" said the father. ""But he must be truly kind,"" insisted the mother.

Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his
two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had
little to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the
land, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought
over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he
groaned and said to his wife: ‘What is to become of us? How are we
to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for
ourselves?’ ‘I’ll tell you what, husband,’ answered the woman, ‘early
tomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where
it is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them, and give each
of them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and
leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be
rid of them.’ ‘No, wife,’ said the man, ‘I will not do that; how can I
bear to leave my children alone in the forest?--the wild animals would
soon come and tear them to pieces.’ ‘O, you fool!’ said she, ‘then we
must all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our
coffins,’ and she left him no peace until he consented. ‘But I feel very
sorry for the poor children, all the same,’ said the man.

The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had
heard what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept
bitter tears, and said to Hansel: ‘Now all is over with us.’ ‘Be quiet,
Gretel,’ said Hansel, ‘do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way
to help us.’ And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put
on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon
shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house
glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the
little pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he went
back and said to Gretel: ‘Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in
peace, God will not forsake us,’ and he lay down again in his bed. When
day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the
two children, saying: ‘Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the
forest to fetch wood.’ She gave each a little piece of bread, and said:
‘There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then,
for you will get nothing else.’ Gretel took the bread under her apron,
as Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out together
on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel
stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again.
His father said: ‘Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying
behind for? Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs.’ ‘Ah,
father,’ said Hansel, ‘I am looking at my little white cat, which is
sitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me.’ The wife said:
‘Fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is
shining on the chimneys.’ Hansel, however, had not been looking back at
the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones
out of his pocket on the road.

When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: ‘Now,
children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not
be cold.’ Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a
little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning
very high, the woman said: ‘Now, children, lay yourselves down by the
fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we
have done, we will come back and fetch you away.’

Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little
piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they
believed that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but
a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was
blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long
time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When
at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and
said: ‘How are we to get out of the forest now?’ But Hansel comforted
her and said: ‘Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we
will soon find the way.’ And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took
his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like
newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.

They walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more
to their father’s house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman
opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: ‘You naughty
children, why have you slept so long in the forest?--we thought you were
never coming back at all!’ The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut
him to the heart to leave them behind alone.

Not long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the
land, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their
father: ‘Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that
is the end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the
wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other
means of saving ourselves!’ The man’s heart was heavy, and he thought:
‘It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your
children.’ The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to
say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise,
and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time
also.

The children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation.
When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go
out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked
the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his
little sister, and said: ‘Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the
good God will help us.’

Early in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their
beds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller
than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his
in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground.
‘Hansel, why do you stop and look round?’ said the father, ‘go on.’ ‘I
am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and
wants to say goodbye to me,’ answered Hansel. ‘Fool!’ said the woman,
‘that is not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining
on the chimney.’ Hansel, however little by little, threw all the crumbs
on the path.

The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had
never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and
the mother said: ‘Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired
you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in
the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.’ When
it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had
scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but
no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark
night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said: ‘Just wait,
Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread
which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.’ When
the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many
thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked
them all up. Hansel said to Gretel: ‘We shall soon find the way,’ but
they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day
too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest,
and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three
berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their
legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell
asleep.

It was now three mornings since they had left their father’s house. They
began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if
help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it
was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough,
which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And
when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them,
and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of
which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw
that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows
were of clear sugar. ‘We will set to work on that,’ said Hansel, ‘and
have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat
some of the window, it will taste sweet.’ Hansel reached up above, and
broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant
against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried
from the parlour:

 ‘Nibble, nibble, gnaw,
  Who is nibbling at my little house?’

The children answered:

 ‘The wind, the wind,
  The heaven-born wind,’

and went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the
taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out
the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with
it. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who
supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were
so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their
hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said: ‘Oh, you dear
children, who has brought you here? do come in, and stay with me. No
harm shall happen to you.’ She took them both by the hand, and led them
into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and
pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little
beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down
in them, and thought they were in heaven.

The old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality
a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the
little house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell
into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast
day with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have
a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near.
When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighbourhood, she laughed with
malice, and said mockingly: ‘I have them, they shall not escape me
again!’ Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was
already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so
pretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself: ‘That
will be a dainty mouthful!’ Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled
hand, carried him into a little stable, and locked him in behind a
grated door. Scream as he might, it would not help him. Then she went to
Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: ‘Get up, lazy thing, fetch
some water, and cook something good for your brother, he is in the
stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.’
Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for she was
forced to do what the wicked witch commanded.

And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing
but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and
cried: ‘Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon
be fat.’ Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and
the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was
Hansel’s finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening
him. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she
was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. ‘Now, then,
Gretel,’ she cried to the girl, ‘stir yourself, and bring some water.
Let Hansel be fat or lean, tomorrow I will kill him, and cook him.’ Ah,
how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water,
and how her tears did flow down her cheeks! ‘Dear God, do help us,’ she
cried. ‘If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should
at any rate have died together.’ ‘Just keep your noise to yourself,’
said the old woman, ‘it won’t help you at all.’

Early in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with
the water, and light the fire. ‘We will bake first,’ said the old woman,
‘I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.’ She pushed poor
Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting.
‘Creep in,’ said the witch, ‘and see if it is properly heated, so that
we can put the bread in.’ And once Gretel was inside, she intended to
shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too.
But Gretel saw what she had in mind, and said: ‘I do not know how I am
to do it; how do I get in?’ ‘Silly goose,’ said the old woman. ‘The door
is big enough; just look, I can get in myself!’ and she crept up and
thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove
her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then
she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away and the godless
witch was miserably burnt to death.

Gretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable,
and cried: ‘Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!’ Then Hansel
sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened. How they did
rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And
as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch’s
house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels.
‘These are far better than pebbles!’ said Hansel, and thrust into his
pockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said: ‘I, too, will take
something home with me,’ and filled her pinafore full. ‘But now we must
be off,’ said Hansel, ‘that we may get out of the witch’s forest.’

When they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of
water. ‘We cannot cross,’ said Hansel, ‘I see no foot-plank, and no
bridge.’ ‘And there is also no ferry,’ answered Gretel, ‘but a white
duck is swimming there: if I ask her, she will help us over.’ Then she
cried:

 ‘Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,
  Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?
  There’s never a plank, or bridge in sight,
  Take us across on thy back so white.’

The duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told
his sister to sit by him. ‘No,’ replied Gretel, ‘that will be too heavy
for the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.’ The
good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had
walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar
to them, and at length they saw from afar their father’s house. Then
they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round
their father’s neck. The man had not known one happy hour since he had
left the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel
emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the
room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to
add to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together
in perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse; whosoever
catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.

","Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between the mountains, lived a poor cobbler with his wife and their two children, a boy named Lukas and a girl named Greta. The family was struggling to make ends meet, and when the harsh winter set in, their situation became dire. The cobbler's wife, filled with despair, whispered to her husband one night, ""We must get rid of the children. We cannot feed them, and they will only slow us down."" The cobbler, torn between his love for his children and the reality of their situation, agreed reluctantly.

The following morning, the family set out early, taking Lukas and Greta deep into the forest. They gave each child a piece of bread and a small bag, and left them by a fire they had built. ""We will return for you later,"" the cobbler said, his voice trembling. ""But we cannot feed you anymore.""

Lukas and Greta, however, had heard their parents' conversation. Greta wept quietly, while Lukas vowed to find a way to save them. As night fell, Lukas crept out of their makeshift shelter and began to gather acorns, filling his bag to the brim.

The next day, the parents returned to the fire, pretending to be concerned for their children. But as they walked deeper into the forest, Lukas scattered the acorns behind him. When they reached a clearing, they built a larger fire and left the children alone once more.

Lukas and Greta spent three days and nights in the forest, living off the acorns and the water they found in a nearby stream. On the third night, they heard a beautiful song coming from a nearby tree. A beautiful bird, with feathers as white as snow, perched on a branch and sang to them. Lukas and Greta followed the bird, and soon came across a small house, made entirely of candy and sweets.

Inside the house, an old witch lived, who had been luring children into her home for years. She was overjoyed to find Lukas and Greta, and welcomed them with open arms. But the children were wary, and when the witch was asleep, they slipped away and found their way back to their father's home.

The cobbler was overjoyed to see his children safe and sound, and he and his wife were filled with regret for their actions. From that day on, the family lived in harmony, and the cobbler vowed never to let his children go hungry again.

There was once a king, whose queen had hair of the purest gold, and was
so beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole face of
the earth. But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she felt that her
end drew near she called the king to her and said, ‘Promise me that you
will never marry again, unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful
as I am, and who has golden hair like mine.’ Then when the king in his
grief promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died. But the king
was not to be comforted, and for a long time never thought of taking
another wife. At last, however, his wise men said, ‘this will not do;
the king must marry again, that we may have a queen.’ So messengers were
sent far and wide, to seek for a bride as beautiful as the late queen.
But there was no princess in the world so beautiful; and if there had
been, still there was not one to be found who had golden hair. So the
messengers came home, and had had all their trouble for nothing.

Now the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother,
and had the same golden hair. And when she was grown up, the king looked
at her and saw that she was just like this late queen: then he said to
his courtiers, ‘May I not marry my daughter? She is the very image of my
dead wife: unless I have her, I shall not find any bride upon the whole
earth, and you say there must be a queen.’ When the courtiers heard this
they were shocked, and said, ‘Heaven forbid that a father should marry
his daughter! Out of so great a sin no good can come.’ And his daughter
was also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts;
so she said to him, ‘Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses:
one must be of gold, like the sun; another must be of shining silver,
like the moon; and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this,
I want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to
which every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin.’ And thus
she thought he would think of the matter no more. But the king made the
most skilful workmen in his kingdom weave the three dresses: one golden,
like the sun; another silvery, like the moon; and a third sparkling,
like the stars: and his hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in
his kingdom, and to take the finest fur out of their skins: and thus a
mantle of a thousand furs was made.

When all were ready, the king sent them to her; but she got up in the
night when all were asleep, and took three of her trinkets, a golden
ring, a golden necklace, and a golden brooch, and packed the three
dresses--of the sun, the moon, and the stars--up in a nutshell, and
wrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur, and besmeared
her face and hands with soot. Then she threw herself upon Heaven for
help in her need, and went away, and journeyed on the whole night, till
at last she came to a large wood. As she was very tired, she sat herself
down in the hollow of a tree and soon fell asleep: and there she slept
on till it was midday.

Now as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it, his dogs
came to the tree, and began to snuff about, and run round and round, and
bark. ‘Look sharp!’ said the king to the huntsmen, ‘and see what sort
of game lies there.’ And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and when they
came back again said, ‘In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful
beast, such as we never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand
kinds of fur, but there it lies fast asleep.’ ‘See,’ said the king, ‘if
you can catch it alive, and we will take it with us.’ So the huntsmen
took it up, and the maiden awoke and was greatly frightened, and said,
‘I am a poor child that has neither father nor mother left; have pity on
me and take me with you.’ Then they said, ‘Yes, Miss Cat-skin, you will
do for the kitchen; you can sweep up the ashes, and do things of that
sort.’ So they put her into the coach, and took her home to the king’s
palace. Then they showed her a little corner under the staircase, where
no light of day ever peeped in, and said, ‘Cat-skin, you may lie and
sleep there.’ And she was sent into the kitchen, and made to fetch wood
and water, to blow the fire, pluck the poultry, pick the herbs, sift the
ashes, and do all the dirty work.

Thus Cat-skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully. ‘Ah! pretty
princess!’ thought she, ‘what will now become of thee?’ But it happened
one day that a feast was to be held in the king’s castle, so she said to
the cook, ‘May I go up a little while and see what is going on? I will
take care and stand behind the door.’ And the cook said, ‘Yes, you may
go, but be back again in half an hour’s time, to rake out the ashes.’
Then she took her little lamp, and went into her cabin, and took off the
fur skin, and washed the soot from off her face and hands, so that her
beauty shone forth like the sun from behind the clouds. She next opened
her nutshell, and brought out of it the dress that shone like the sun,
and so went to the feast. Everyone made way for her, for nobody knew
her, and they thought she could be no less than a king’s daughter. But
the king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and
he thought in his heart, ‘I never saw any one half so beautiful.’

When the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked
round for her, she was gone, no one knew wither. The guards that stood
at the castle gate were called in: but they had seen no one. The truth
was, that she had run into her little cabin, pulled off her dress,
blackened her face and hands, put on the fur-skin cloak, and was
Cat-skin again. When she went into the kitchen to her work, and began
to rake the ashes, the cook said, ‘Let that alone till the morning, and
heat the king’s soup; I should like to run up now and give a peep: but
take care you don’t let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of
never eating again.’

As soon as the cook went away, Cat-skin heated the king’s soup, and
toasted a slice of bread first, as nicely as ever she could; and when it
was ready, she went and looked in the cabin for her little golden ring,
and put it into the dish in which the soup was. When the dance was over,
the king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well,
that he thought he had never tasted any so good before. At the bottom
he saw a gold ring lying; and as he could not make out how it had got
there, he ordered the cook to be sent for. The cook was frightened when
he heard the order, and said to Cat-skin, ‘You must have let a hair fall
into the soup; if it be so, you will have a good beating.’ Then he went
before the king, and he asked him who had cooked the soup. ‘I did,’
answered the cook. But the king said, ‘That is not true; it was better
done than you could do it.’ Then he answered, ‘To tell the truth I did
not cook it, but Cat-skin did.’ ‘Then let Cat-skin come up,’ said the
king: and when she came he said to her, ‘Who are you?’ ‘I am a poor
child,’ said she, ‘that has lost both father and mother.’ ‘How came you
in my palace?’ asked he. ‘I am good for nothing,’ said she, ‘but to be
scullion-girl, and to have boots and shoes thrown at my head.’ ‘But how
did you get the ring that was in the soup?’ asked the king. Then she
would not own that she knew anything about the ring; so the king sent
her away again about her business.

After a time there was another feast, and Cat-skin asked the cook to let
her go up and see it as before. ‘Yes,’ said he, ‘but come again in half
an hour, and cook the king the soup that he likes so much.’ Then she
ran to her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her dress
out which was silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she went in,
looking like a king’s daughter, the king went up to her, and rejoiced at
seeing her again, and when the dance began he danced with her. After the
dance was at an end she managed to slip out, so slyly that the king did
not see where she was gone; but she sprang into her little cabin, and
made herself into Cat-skin again, and went into the kitchen to cook the
soup. Whilst the cook was above stairs, she got the golden necklace and
dropped it into the soup; then it was brought to the king, who ate it,
and it pleased him as well as before; so he sent for the cook, who
was again forced to tell him that Cat-skin had cooked it. Cat-skin was
brought again before the king, but she still told him that she was only
fit to have boots and shoes thrown at her head.

But when the king had ordered a feast to be got ready for the third
time, it happened just the same as before. ‘You must be a witch,
Cat-skin,’ said the cook; ‘for you always put something into your soup,
so that it pleases the king better than mine.’ However, he let her go up
as before. Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars, and
went into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again, and
thought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then. So whilst
he was dancing with her, he put a gold ring on her finger without her
seeing it, and ordered that the dance should be kept up a long time.
When it was at an end, he would have held her fast by the hand, but she
slipped away, and sprang so quickly through the crowd that he lost sight
of her: and she ran as fast as she could into her little cabin under
the stairs. But this time she kept away too long, and stayed beyond the
half-hour; so she had not time to take off her fine dress, and threw her
fur mantle over it, and in her haste did not blacken herself all over
with soot, but left one of her fingers white.

Then she ran into the kitchen, and cooked the king’s soup; and as soon
as the cook was gone, she put the golden brooch into the dish. When the
king got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and
soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst
they were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and
when she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off
a little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.

Then he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and
beautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so she
washed the soot and ashes from her face, and showed herself to be the
most beautiful princess upon the face of the earth. But the king said,
‘You are my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each
other.’ And the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as ever
was heard of or seen in that country, or indeed in any other.
A farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to
him: but he was now grown too old to work; so the farmer would give him
nothing more to eat, and said, ‘I want you no longer, so take yourself
off out of my stable; I shall not take you back again until you are
stronger than a lion.’ Then he opened the door and turned him adrift.

The poor horse was very melancholy, and wandered up and down in the
wood, seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain. Presently
a fox met him: ‘What’s the matter, my friend?’ said he, ‘why do you hang
down your head and look so lonely and woe-begone?’ ‘Ah!’ replied the
horse, ‘justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has
forgotten all that I have done for him so many years, and because I
can no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless I become
stronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can I
have of that? he knows I have none, or he would not talk so.’

However, the fox bid him be of good cheer, and said, ‘I will help you;
lie down there, stretch yourself out quite stiff, and pretend to be
dead.’ The horse did as he was told, and the fox went straight to the
lion who lived in a cave close by, and said to him, ‘A little way off
lies a dead horse; come with me and you may make an excellent meal of
his carcase.’ The lion was greatly pleased, and set off immediately; and
when they came to the horse, the fox said, ‘You will not be able to eat
him comfortably here; I’ll tell you what--I will tie you fast to
his tail, and then you can draw him to your den, and eat him at your
leisure.’

This advice pleased the lion, so he laid himself down quietly for the
fox to make him fast to the horse. But the fox managed to tie his legs
together and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength he
could not set himself free. When the work was done, the fox clapped the
horse on the shoulder, and said, ‘Jip! Dobbin! Jip!’ Then up he sprang,
and moved off, dragging the lion behind him. The beast began to roar
and bellow, till all the birds of the wood flew away for fright; but the
horse let him sing on, and made his way quietly over the fields to his
master’s house.

‘Here he is, master,’ said he, ‘I have got the better of him’: and when
the farmer saw his old servant, his heart relented, and he said. ‘Thou
shalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of.’ And so the poor old
horse had plenty to eat, and lived--till he died.

There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so
the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he
did spill a little of anything.

Now, tell a single original traditional German folktale based on the structure and style above. Do not generate multiple stories. Only one  story should be created, and it should follow the same narrative structure as the examples above. Conclude the story with 'The End.'

","There was once a king, whose queen had hair as dark as the midnight sky, and was so beautiful that her match was not to be found on the whole face of the earth. But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she felt that her end drew near she called the king to her and said, ‘Promise me that you will never marry again, unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful as I am, and who has hair as dark as mine.’ Then when the king in his grief promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died. But the king was not to be comforted, and for a long time never thought of taking another wife. At last, however, his wise men said, ‘this will not do; the king must marry again, that we may have a queen.’ So messengers were sent far and wide, to seek for a bride as beautiful as the late queen. But there was no princess in the world so beautiful; and if there had been, still there was not one to be found who had hair as dark as the moon. So the messengers came home, and had had all their trouble for nothing.

Now the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother, and had the same dark hair. And when she was grown up, the king looked at her and saw that she was just like this late queen: then he said to his courtiers, ‘May I not marry my daughter? She is the very image of my dead wife: unless I have her, I shall not find any bride upon the whole earth, and you say there must be a queen.’ When the courtiers heard this they were shocked, and said, ‘Heaven forbid that a father should marry his daughter! Out of so great a sin no good can come.’ And his daughter was also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts; so she said to him, ‘Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses: one must be of silver, like the moon; another must be of shining gold, like the sun; and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this, I want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to which every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin.’ And thus she thought he would think of the matter no more. But the king made the most skilful workmen in his kingdom weave the three dresses: one silver, like the moon; another golden, like the sun; and a third sparkling, like the stars: and his hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in his kingdom, and to take the finest fur out of their skins: and thus a mantle of a thousand furs was made.

When all were ready, the king sent them to her; but she got up in the night when all were asleep, and took three of her trinkets, a silver ring, a silver necklace, and a silver brooch, and packed the three dresses--of the moon, the sun, and the stars--up in a nutshell, and wrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur, and dyed her face and hands with charcoal. Then she threw herself upon Heaven for help in her need, and went away, and journeyed on the whole night, till at last she came to a large wood. As she was very tired, she sat herself down in the hollow of a tree and soon fell asleep: and there she slept on till it was midday.

Now as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it, his dogs came to the tree, and began to snuff about, and run round and round, and bark. ‘Look sharp!’ said the king to the huntsmen, ‘and see what sort of game lies there.’ And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and when they came back again said, ‘In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful beast, such as we never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand kinds of fur, but there it lies fast asleep.’ ‘See,’ said the king, ‘if you can catch it alive, and we will take it with us.’ So the huntsmen took it up, and the maiden awoke and was greatly frightened, and said, ‘I am a poor child that has neither father nor mother.’ Have pity on me and take me with you.’ Then they said, ‘Yes, Miss Moon-skin, you will do for the kitchen; you can sweep up the ashes, and do things of that sort.’ So they put her into the coach, and took her home to the king’s palace. Then they showed her a little corner under the staircase, where no light of day ever peeped in, and said, ‘Moon-skin, you may lie and sleep there.’ And she was sent into the kitchen, and made to fetch wood and water, to blow the fire, pluck the poultry, pick the herbs, sift the ashes, and do all the dirty work.

Thus Moon-skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully. ‘Ah! pretty princess!’ thought she, ‘what will now become of thee?’ But it happened one day that a feast was to be held in the king’s castle, so she said to the cook, ‘May I go up a little while and see what is going on? I will take care and stand behind the door.’ And the cook said, ‘Yes, you may go, but be back again in half an hour’s time, to rake out the ashes.’ Then she took her little lamp, and went into her cabin, and took off the fur skin, and washed the charcoal from her face and hands, so that her beauty shone forth like the sun from behind the clouds. She next opened her nutshell, and brought out of it the dress that shone like the sun, and so went to the feast. Everyone made way for her, for nobody knew her, and they thought she could be no less than a king’s daughter. But the king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and he thought in his heart, ‘I never saw any one half so beautiful.’

When the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked round for her, she was gone, no one knew wither. The guards that stood at the castle gate were called in: but they had seen no one. The truth was, that she had run into her little cabin, and made herself into Moon-skin again. When she went into the kitchen to her work, and began to rake the ashes, the cook said, ‘Let that alone till the morning, and heat the king’s soup; I should like to run up now and give a peep: but take care you don’t let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of never eating again.’

As soon as the cook was gone, Moon-skin heated the king’s soup, and toasted a slice of bread first, as nicely as ever she could; and when it was ready, she went and looked in the cabin for her little silver ring, and put it into the dish in which the soup was. When the dance was over, the king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well, that he thought he had never tasted any so good before. At the bottom he saw a silver ring lying; and as he could not make out how it had got there, he ordered the cook to be sent for. The cook was frightened when he heard the order, and said to Moon-skin, ‘You must have let a hair fall into the soup; if it be so, you will have a good beating.’ Then he went before the king, and he asked him who had cooked the soup. ‘I did,’ answered the cook. But the king said, ‘That is not true; it was better done than you could do it.’ Then he answered, ‘To tell the truth I did not cook it, but Moon-skin did.’ ‘Then let Moon-skin come up,’ said the king: and when she came he said to her, ‘Who are you?’ ‘I am a poor child,’ said she, ‘that has lost both father and mother.’ ‘How came you in my palace?’ asked he. ‘I am good for nothing,’ said she, ‘but to"

There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a
child. At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire.
These people had a little window at the back of their house from which
a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful
flowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no
one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had
great power and was dreaded by all the world. One day the woman was
standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a
bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it
looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away,
and began to look pale and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed, and
asked: ‘What ails you, dear wife?’ ‘Ah,’ she replied, ‘if I can’t eat
some of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall
die.’ The man, who loved her, thought: ‘Sooner than let your wife die,
bring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.’
At twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the
enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his
wife. She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily. It
tasted so good to her--so very good, that the next day she longed for it
three times as much as before. If he was to have any rest, her husband
must once more descend into the garden. In the gloom of evening
therefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the
wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before
him. ‘How can you dare,’ said she with angry look, ‘descend into my
garden and steal my rampion like a thief? You shall suffer for it!’
‘Ah,’ answered he, ‘let mercy take the place of justice, I only made
up my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the
window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she
had not got some to eat.’ Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be
softened, and said to him: ‘If the case be as you say, I will allow
you to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one
condition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into
the world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a
mother.’ The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the
woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the
child the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.

Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was
twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in
a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a
little window. When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself
beneath it and cried:

 ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
  Let down your hair to me.’

Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she
heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses,
wound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair
fell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.

After a year or two, it came to pass that the king’s son rode through
the forest and passed by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so
charming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her
solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The king’s
son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower,
but none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so deeply
touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and
listened to it. Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw
that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried:

 ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
  Let down your hair to me.’

Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress
climbed up to her. ‘If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too
will try my fortune,’ said he, and the next day when it began to grow
dark, he went to the tower and cried:

 ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
  Let down your hair to me.’

Immediately the hair fell down and the king’s son climbed up.

At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes
had never yet beheld, came to her; but the king’s son began to talk to
her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred
that it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her.
Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take
him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she
thought: ‘He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does’; and she said
yes, and laid her hand in his. She said: ‘I will willingly go away with
you, but I do not know how to get down. Bring with you a skein of silk
every time that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when
that is ready I will descend, and you will take me on your horse.’ They
agreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the
old woman came by day. The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until
once Rapunzel said to her: ‘Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that
you are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young king’s son--he
is with me in a moment.’ ‘Ah! you wicked child,’ cried the enchantress.
‘What do I hear you say! I thought I had separated you from all
the world, and yet you have deceived me!’ In her anger she clutched
Rapunzel’s beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand,
seized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut
off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground. And she was so pitiless
that she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great
grief and misery.

On the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however, the enchantress
fastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the
window, and when the king’s son came and cried:

 ‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
  Let down your hair to me.’

she let the hair down. The king’s son ascended, but instead of finding
his dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with
wicked and venomous looks. ‘Aha!’ she cried mockingly, ‘you would fetch
your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest;
the cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel is
lost to you; you will never see her again.’ The king’s son was beside
himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower. He
escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell pierced his
eyes. Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but
roots and berries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of
his dearest wife. Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at
length came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she
had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness. He heard a
voice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and
when he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept. Two
of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could
see with them as before. He led her to his kingdom where he was
joyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and
contented.
It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to
herself: ‘He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the
world,’ she spoke to him in a friendly way. ‘Good day, dear Mr Fox,
how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard
times?’ The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from
head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give
any answer or not. At last he said: ‘Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you
piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have
you the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How
many arts do you understand?’ ‘I understand but one,’ replied the
cat, modestly. ‘What art is that?’ asked the fox. ‘When the hounds are
following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.’ ‘Is that all?’
said the fox. ‘I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain
a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will
teach you how people get away from the hounds.’ Just then came a hunter
with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top
of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. ‘Open your
sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,’ cried the cat to him, but the dogs had
already seized him, and were holding him fast. ‘Ah, Mr Fox,’ cried the
cat. ‘You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been
able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.’

A farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard for
him three years, without having been paid any wages. At last it came
into the man’s head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer;
so he went to his master, and said, ‘I have worked hard for you a long
time, I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for my
trouble.’ The farmer was a sad miser, and knew that his man was very
simple-hearted; so he took out threepence, and gave him for every year’s
service a penny. The poor fellow thought it was a great deal of money to
have, and said to himself, ‘Why should I work hard, and live here on bad
fare any longer? I can now travel into the wide world, and make myself
merry.’ With that he put his money into his purse, and set out, roaming
over hill and valley.

As he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little dwarf
met him, and asked him what made him so merry. ‘Why, what should make
me down-hearted?’ said he; ‘I am sound in health and rich in purse, what
should I care for? I have saved up my three years’ earnings and have it
all safe in my pocket.’ ‘How much may it come to?’ said the little man.
‘Full threepence,’ replied the countryman. ‘I wish you would give them
to me,’ said the other; ‘I am very poor.’ Then the man pitied him, and
gave him all he had; and the little dwarf said in return, ‘As you have
such a kind honest heart, I will grant you three wishes--one for every
penny; so choose whatever you like.’ Then the countryman rejoiced at
his good luck, and said, ‘I like many things better than money: first, I
will have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly,
a fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and
thirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask.’ The dwarf
said he should have his three wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle,
and went his way.

Our honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before,
he was now ten times more so. He had not gone far before he met an old
miser: close by them stood a tree, and on the topmost twig sat a thrush
singing away most joyfully. ‘Oh, what a pretty bird!’ said the miser; ‘I
would give a great deal of money to have such a one.’ ‘If that’s all,’
said the countryman, ‘I will soon bring it down.’ Then he took up his
bow, and down fell the thrush into the bushes at the foot of the tree.
The miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into
the middle, his companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the
miser began to dance and spring about, capering higher and higher in
the air. The thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hung
in rags about him, and he himself was all scratched and wounded, so that
the blood ran down. ‘Oh, for heaven’s sake!’ cried the miser, ‘Master!
master! pray let the fiddle alone. What have I done to deserve this?’
‘Thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough,’ said the other; ‘thou
art only meeting thy reward’: so he played up another tune. Then the
miser began to beg and promise, and offered money for his liberty; but
he did not come up to the musician’s price for some time, and he danced
him along brisker and brisker, and the miser bid higher and higher, till
at last he offered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purse,
and had just gained by cheating some poor fellow. When the countryman
saw so much money, he said, ‘I will agree to your proposal.’ So he took
the purse, put up his fiddle, and travelled on very pleased with his
bargain.

Meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous
plight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve
his late companion some trick. At last he went to the judge, and
complained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him
into the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his
back and a fiddle hung round his neck. Then the judge sent out his
officers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him; and he
was soon caught and brought up to be tried.

The miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of
his money. ‘No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you.’ said the
countryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the
matter short by ordering him off to the gallows.

So away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said, ‘My Lord
Judge, grant me one last request.’ ‘Anything but thy life,’ replied the
other. ‘No,’ said he, ‘I do not ask my life; only to let me play upon
my fiddle for the last time.’ The miser cried out, ‘Oh, no! no! for
heaven’s sake don’t listen to him! don’t listen to him!’ But the judge
said, ‘It is only this once, he will soon have done.’ The fact was, he
could not refuse the request, on account of the dwarf’s third gift.

Then the miser said, ‘Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity’s sake.’ But
the countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the first
note judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began capering, and
no one could hold the miser. At the second note the hangman let his
prisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first
bar of the tune, all were dancing together--judge, court, and miser, and
all the people who had followed to look on. At first the thing was merry
and pleasant enough; but when it had gone on a while, and there seemed
to be no end of playing or dancing, they began to cry out, and beg him
to leave off; but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreaties,
till the judge not only gave him his life, but promised to return him
the hundred florins.

Then he called to the miser, and said, ‘Tell us now, you vagabond, where
you got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only,’ ‘I stole
it,’ said the miser in the presence of all the people; ‘I acknowledge
that I stole it, and that you earned it fairly.’ Then the countryman
stopped his fiddle, and left the miser to take his place at the gallows.

","There was once a poor woodcutter who lived in a small cottage deep in the forest. He had a kind heart and worked hard every day, but he was never able to make ends meet. One day, as he was chopping wood near a stream, he heard a beautiful voice singing. He followed the sound and found a beautiful maiden sitting by the water's edge. She was so beautiful that he was struck dumb with amazement.

""Who are you?"" he asked, finally finding his voice.

""I am the water sprite,"" she replied. ""I have been trapped here by an evil sorcerer. He has cast a spell on me, and I cannot leave this place.""

The woodcutter felt a pang of pity in his heart. ""I will help you,"" he said. ""I will find a way to break the sorcerer's spell and set you free.""

The water sprite looked at him with gratitude in her eyes. ""Thank you,"" she said. ""But beware, the sorcerer is powerful and cunning. You may not succeed.""

The woodcutter nodded determinedly. He returned to his cottage and spent the next several days researching and studying ancient spells and enchantments. Finally, he felt ready to confront the sorcerer.

He made his way to the sorcerer's castle, which was hidden deep in the forest. He approached the castle gates and called out a challenge. The sorcerer, who was named Malachor, appeared on the balcony above.

""Who dares to challenge me?"" he sneered. ""I am the most powerful sorcerer in the land. I have conquered many realms and taken many treasures. Who are you to stand before me?""

""I am a humble woodcutter,"" the woodcutter replied. ""But I have come to challenge you and break the spell you have cast on the water sprite.""

Malachor laughed. ""Very well, I will test your skills. If you can answer three riddles, I will release the water sprite. But if you fail, you will be cursed to wander the forest for all eternity.""

The woodcutter nodded. ""I accept your challenge.""

Malachor smiled coldly. ""Very well. First riddle: What is so fragile that saying its name breaks it?""

The woodcutter thought for a moment. ""A promise,"" he said.

Malachor's smile faded. ""Correct. Second riddle: What is so light that it can travel around the world in a single day?""

The woodcutter thought for a moment. ""A feather,"" he said.

Malachor's smile returned. ""Correct. Third riddle: What is so powerful that it can make a man forget his own name?""

The woodcutter thought for a moment. ""Love,"" he said.

Malachor's smile disappeared, and his eyes narrowed. ""Correct. You have answered all three riddles correctly. I must release the water sprite.""

The woodcutter smiled in triumph. ""I have won,"" he said.

Malachor sneered. ""You have won nothing. I have allowed you to win, but I will still curse you to wander the forest for all eternity. You have dared to challenge me, and for that, you will pay the price.""

The woodcutter looked at the water sprite, who was watching the scene with tears in her eyes. ""I have failed,"" he said. ""I have allowed my pride to blind me, and I have lost everything.""

The water sprite shook her head. ""No, you have not failed,"" she said. ""You have shown courage and determination. You have fought for me, and for that, I will never forget you.""

With that, she leaned forward and kissed the woodcutter on the cheek. Suddenly, the chains that held her to the stream broke, and she rose into the air, glowing with a beautiful light.

""Thank you,"" she said to the woodcutter. ""You have set me free, and for that, I will grant you one wish.""

The woodcutter looked at her, tears in his eyes. ""I have no wish,"" he said. ""I have found what is truly important. I have found love, and that is worth more than any treasure.""

The water sprite smiled. ""Very well,"" she said. ""I will grant you one wish, but it must be something small. What do you wish for?""

The woodcutter thought for a moment. ""I wish for a single acorn,"" he said. ""I will plant it in my garden, and it will grow into a mighty oak. And beneath that oak, I will build a home for myself and my family, and we will live in peace and happiness for all our days.""

The water sprite nodded. ""Your wish is granted,"" she said. ""Go in peace, and may your days be filled with love and happiness.""

The woodcutter nodded, and the water sprite disappeared, leaving him alone in the forest. He picked up the acorn and placed it in his pocket, and he walked back to his cottage, his heart full of love and hope.

And so it was that the woodcutter built a home beneath the mighty oak, and he and his family lived in peace and happiness for all their days. And whenever anyone passed by the oak, they would stop and marvel at its size and beauty, and they would remember the story of the woodcutter and the water sprite, and the love that had set them both free.

It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to
herself: ‘He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the
world,’ she spoke to him in a friendly way. ‘Good day, dear Mr Fox,
how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard
times?’ The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from
head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give
any answer or not. At last he said: ‘Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you
piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have
you the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How
many arts do you understand?’ ‘I understand but one,’ replied the
cat, modestly. ‘What art is that?’ asked the fox. ‘When the hounds are
following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.’ ‘Is that all?’
said the fox. ‘I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain
a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will
teach you how people get away from the hounds.’ Just then came a hunter
with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top
of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. ‘Open your
sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,’ cried the cat to him, but the dogs had
already seized him, and were holding him fast. ‘Ah, Mr Fox,’ cried the
cat. ‘You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been
able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.’
There was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close
by the seaside. The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing; and
one day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the sparkling
waves and watching his line, all on a sudden his float was dragged away
deep into the water: and in drawing it up he pulled out a great fish.
But the fish said, ‘Pray let me live! I am not a real fish; I am an
enchanted prince: put me in the water again, and let me go!’ ‘Oh, ho!’
said the man, ‘you need not make so many words about the matter; I will
have nothing to do with a fish that can talk: so swim away, sir, as soon
as you please!’ Then he put him back into the water, and the fish darted
straight down to the bottom, and left a long streak of blood behind him
on the wave.

When the fisherman went home to his wife in the pigsty, he told her how
he had caught a great fish, and how it had told him it was an enchanted
prince, and how, on hearing it speak, he had let it go again. ‘Did not
you ask it for anything?’ said the wife, ‘we live very wretchedly here,
in this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the fish we want a snug
little cottage.’

The fisherman did not much like the business: however, he went to the
seashore; and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and
green. And he stood at the water’s edge, and said:

 ‘O man of the sea!
  Hearken to me!
  My wife Ilsabill
  Will have her own will,
  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’

Then the fish came swimming to him, and said, ‘Well, what is her will?
What does your wife want?’ ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘she says that when
I had caught you, I ought to have asked you for something before I let
you go; she does not like living any longer in the pigsty, and wants
a snug little cottage.’ ‘Go home, then,’ said the fish; ‘she is in the
cottage already!’ So the man went home, and saw his wife standing at the
door of a nice trim little cottage. ‘Come in, come in!’ said she; ‘is
not this much better than the filthy pigsty we had?’ And there was a
parlour, and a bedchamber, and a kitchen; and behind the cottage there
was a little garden, planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits; and
there was a courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens. ‘Ah!’ said the
fisherman, ‘how happily we shall live now!’ ‘We will try to do so, at
least,’ said his wife.

Everything went right for a week or two, and then Dame Ilsabill said,
‘Husband, there is not near room enough for us in this cottage; the
courtyard and the garden are a great deal too small; I should like to
have a large stone castle to live in: go to the fish again and tell him
to give us a castle.’ ‘Wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘I don’t like to go to
him again, for perhaps he will be angry; we ought to be easy with this
pretty cottage to live in.’ ‘Nonsense!’ said the wife; ‘he will do it
very willingly, I know; go along and try!’

The fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy: and when he came to
the sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was very calm; and he went
close to the edge of the waves, and said:

 ‘O man of the sea!
  Hearken to me!
  My wife Ilsabill
  Will have her own will,
  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’

‘Well, what does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the man,
dolefully, ‘my wife wants to live in a stone castle.’ ‘Go home, then,’
said the fish; ‘she is standing at the gate of it already.’ So away went
the fisherman, and found his wife standing before the gate of a great
castle. ‘See,’ said she, ‘is not this grand?’ With that they went into
the castle together, and found a great many servants there, and the
rooms all richly furnished, and full of golden chairs and tables; and
behind the castle was a garden, and around it was a park half a
mile long, full of sheep, and goats, and hares, and deer; and in the
courtyard were stables and cow-houses. ‘Well,’ said the man, ‘now we
will live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of
our lives.’ ‘Perhaps we may,’ said the wife; ‘but let us sleep upon it,
before we make up our minds to that.’ So they went to bed.

The next morning when Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight, and
she jogged the fisherman with her elbow, and said, ‘Get up, husband,
and bestir yourself, for we must be king of all the land.’ ‘Wife, wife,’
said the man, ‘why should we wish to be the king? I will not be king.’
‘Then I will,’ said she. ‘But, wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘how can you
be king--the fish cannot make you a king?’ ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘say
no more about it, but go and try! I will be king.’ So the man went away
quite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king. This time
the sea looked a dark grey colour, and was overspread with curling waves
and the ridges of foam as he cried out:

 ‘O man of the sea!
  Hearken to me!
  My wife Ilsabill
  Will have her own will,
  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’

‘Well, what would she have now?’ said the fish. ‘Alas!’ said the poor
man, ‘my wife wants to be king.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is king
already.’

Then the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace he saw
a troop of soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and trumpets. And when
he went in he saw his wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamonds,
with a golden crown upon her head; and on each side of her stood six
fair maidens, each a head taller than the other. ‘Well, wife,’ said the
fisherman, ‘are you king?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am king.’ And when he had
looked at her for a long time, he said, ‘Ah, wife! what a fine thing it
is to be king! Now we shall never have anything more to wish for as long
as we live.’ ‘I don’t know how that may be,’ said she; ‘never is a long
time. I am king, it is true; but I begin to be tired of that, and I
think I should like to be emperor.’ ‘Alas, wife! why should you wish to
be emperor?’ said the fisherman. ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘go to the fish!
I say I will be emperor.’ ‘Ah, wife!’ replied the fisherman, ‘the fish
cannot make an emperor, I am sure, and I should not like to ask him for
such a thing.’ ‘I am king,’ said Ilsabill, ‘and you are my slave; so go
at once!’

So the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along,
‘This will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will be
tired at last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done.’ He
soon came to the seashore; and the water was quite black and muddy, and
a mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about, but he
went as near as he could to the water’s brink, and said:

 ‘O man of the sea!
  Hearken to me!
  My wife Ilsabill
  Will have her own will,
  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’

‘What would she have now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman,
‘she wants to be emperor.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is emperor
already.’

So he went home again; and as he came near he saw his wife Ilsabill
sitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great crown on
her head full two yards high; and on each side of her stood her guards
and attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other, from the
tallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger. And
before her stood princes, and dukes, and earls: and the fisherman went
up to her and said, ‘Wife, are you emperor?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am
emperor.’ ‘Ah!’ said the man, as he gazed upon her, ‘what a fine thing
it is to be emperor!’ ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘why should we stop at being
emperor? I will be pope next.’ ‘O wife, wife!’ said he, ‘how can you be
pope? there is but one pope at a time in Christendom.’ ‘Husband,’ said
she, ‘I will be pope this very day.’ ‘But,’ replied the husband, ‘the
fish cannot make you pope.’ ‘What nonsense!’ said she; ‘if he can make
an emperor, he can make a pope: go and try him.’

So the fisherman went. But when he came to the shore the wind was raging
and the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves, and the ships were
in trouble, and rolled fearfully upon the tops of the billows. In the
middle of the heavens there was a little piece of blue sky, but towards
the south all was red, as if a dreadful storm was rising. At this sight
the fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he trembled so that his
knees knocked together: but still he went down near to the shore, and
said:

 ‘O man of the sea!
  Hearken to me!
  My wife Ilsabill
  Will have her own will,
  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’

‘What does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘my
wife wants to be pope.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is pope already.’

Then the fisherman went home, and found Ilsabill sitting on a throne
that was two miles high. And she had three great crowns on her head, and
around her stood all the pomp and power of the Church. And on each side
of her were two rows of burning lights, of all sizes, the greatest as
large as the highest and biggest tower in the world, and the least no
larger than a small rushlight. ‘Wife,’ said the fisherman, as he looked
at all this greatness, ‘are you pope?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am pope.’
‘Well, wife,’ replied he, ‘it is a grand thing to be pope; and now
you must be easy, for you can be nothing greater.’ ‘I will think about
that,’ said the wife. Then they went to bed: but Dame Ilsabill could not
sleep all night for thinking what she should be next. At last, as she
was dropping asleep, morning broke, and the sun rose. ‘Ha!’ thought she,
as she woke up and looked at it through the window, ‘after all I cannot
prevent the sun rising.’ At this thought she was very angry, and wakened
her husband, and said, ‘Husband, go to the fish and tell him I must
be lord of the sun and moon.’ The fisherman was half asleep, but the
thought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed.
‘Alas, wife!’ said he, ‘cannot you be easy with being pope?’ ‘No,’
said she, ‘I am very uneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without my
leave. Go to the fish at once!’

Then the man went shivering with fear; and as he was going down to
the shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks
shook. And all the heavens became black with stormy clouds, and the
lightnings played, and the thunders rolled; and you might have seen in
the sea great black waves, swelling up like mountains with crowns of
white foam upon their heads. And the fisherman crept towards the sea,
and cried out, as well as he could:

 ‘O man of the sea!
  Hearken to me!
  My wife Ilsabill
  Will have her own will,
  And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’

‘What does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said he, ‘she wants to
be lord of the sun and moon.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish, ‘to your pigsty
again.’

And there they live to this very day.

It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to
herself: ‘He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the
world,’ she spoke to him in a friendly way. ‘Good day, dear Mr Fox,
how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard

","Once upon a time, in a dense forest, a rabbit encountered a bear. The rabbit, being small and timid, approached the bear with great caution. ""Good day, dear Mr Bear, how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard times?"" The bear, full of pride, looked down at the rabbit with disdain. ""You, a mere rodent, dare to ask me such questions? What have you learned? What skills do you possess?"" replied the bear. ""I have but one skill,"" said the rabbit, ""I can burrow quickly to escape danger."" ""Is that all?"" sneered the bear. ""I am the master of a hundred skills, and I have a bag full of tricks. You make me pity you; come with me, and I will teach you how to escape from danger.""

Just then, a hunter with a pack of dogs appeared. The rabbit darted into a burrow, disappearing from sight. The bear, however, stood his ground, confident in his abilities. ""Open your bag, Mr Bear, open your bag,"" called the rabbit from the safety of his burrow. But the dogs had already pounced on the bear, and he was soon overpowered. ""Ah, Mr Bear, you with your hundred skills are left in the lurch! Had you been able to burrow like me, you would not have lost your life.""

A poor woodman sat in his cottage one night, smoking his pipe by the
fireside, while his wife sat by his side spinning. ‘How lonely it is,
wife,’ said he, as he puffed out a long curl of smoke, ‘for you and me
to sit here by ourselves, without any children to play about and amuse
us while other people seem so happy and merry with their children!’
‘What you say is very true,’ said the wife, sighing, and turning round
her wheel; ‘how happy should I be if I had but one child! If it were
ever so small--nay, if it were no bigger than my thumb--I should be very
happy, and love it dearly.’ Now--odd as you may think it--it came to
pass that this good woman’s wish was fulfilled, just in the very way she
had wished it; for, not long afterwards, she had a little boy, who was
quite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb. So
they said, ‘Well, we cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and,
little as he is, we will love him dearly.’ And they called him Thomas
Thumb.

They gave him plenty of food, yet for all they could do he never grew
bigger, but kept just the same size as he had been when he was born.
Still, his eyes were sharp and sparkling, and he soon showed himself to
be a clever little fellow, who always knew well what he was about.

One day, as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cut
fuel, he said, ‘I wish I had someone to bring the cart after me, for I
want to make haste.’ ‘Oh, father,’ cried Tom, ‘I will take care of that;
the cart shall be in the wood by the time you want it.’ Then the woodman
laughed, and said, ‘How can that be? you cannot reach up to the horse’s
bridle.’ ‘Never mind that, father,’ said Tom; ‘if my mother will only
harness the horse, I will get into his ear and tell him which way to
go.’ ‘Well,’ said the father, ‘we will try for once.’

When the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart, and put
Tom into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the beast how
to go, crying out, ‘Go on!’ and ‘Stop!’ as he wanted: and thus the horse
went on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the
wood. It happened that as the horse was going a little too fast, and Tom
was calling out, ‘Gently! gently!’ two strangers came up. ‘What an odd
thing that is!’ said one: ‘there is a cart going along, and I hear a
carter talking to the horse, but yet I can see no one.’ ‘That is queer,
indeed,’ said the other; ‘let us follow the cart, and see where it
goes.’ So they went on into the wood, till at last they came to the
place where the woodman was. Then Tom Thumb, seeing his father, cried
out, ‘See, father, here I am with the cart, all right and safe! now take
me down!’ So his father took hold of the horse with one hand, and with
the other took his son out of the horse’s ear, and put him down upon a
straw, where he sat as merry as you please.

The two strangers were all this time looking on, and did not know what
to say for wonder. At last one took the other aside, and said, ‘That
little urchin will make our fortune, if we can get him, and carry him
about from town to town as a show; we must buy him.’ So they went up to
the woodman, and asked him what he would take for the little man. ‘He
will be better off,’ said they, ‘with us than with you.’ ‘I won’t sell
him at all,’ said the father; ‘my own flesh and blood is dearer to me
than all the silver and gold in the world.’ But Tom, hearing of the
bargain they wanted to make, crept up his father’s coat to his shoulder
and whispered in his ear, ‘Take the money, father, and let them have me;
I’ll soon come back to you.’

So the woodman at last said he would sell Tom to the strangers for a
large piece of gold, and they paid the price. ‘Where would you like to
sit?’ said one of them. ‘Oh, put me on the rim of your hat; that will be
a nice gallery for me; I can walk about there and see the country as we
go along.’ So they did as he wished; and when Tom had taken leave of his
father they took him away with them.

They journeyed on till it began to be dusky, and then the little man
said, ‘Let me get down, I’m tired.’ So the man took off his hat, and
put him down on a clod of earth, in a ploughed field by the side of the
road. But Tom ran about amongst the furrows, and at last slipped into
an old mouse-hole. ‘Good night, my masters!’ said he, ‘I’m off! mind and
look sharp after me the next time.’ Then they ran at once to the place,
and poked the ends of their sticks into the mouse-hole, but all in vain;
Tom only crawled farther and farther in; and at last it became quite
dark, so that they were forced to go their way without their prize, as
sulky as could be.

When Tom found they were gone, he came out of his hiding-place. ‘What
dangerous walking it is,’ said he, ‘in this ploughed field! If I were to
fall from one of these great clods, I should undoubtedly break my neck.’
At last, by good luck, he found a large empty snail-shell. ‘This is
lucky,’ said he, ‘I can sleep here very well’; and in he crept.

Just as he was falling asleep, he heard two men passing by, chatting
together; and one said to the other, ‘How can we rob that rich parson’s
house of his silver and gold?’ ‘I’ll tell you!’ cried Tom. ‘What noise
was that?’ said the thief, frightened; ‘I’m sure I heard someone speak.’
They stood still listening, and Tom said, ‘Take me with you, and I’ll
soon show you how to get the parson’s money.’ ‘But where are you?’ said
they. ‘Look about on the ground,’ answered he, ‘and listen where the
sound comes from.’ At last the thieves found him out, and lifted him
up in their hands. ‘You little urchin!’ they said, ‘what can you do for
us?’ ‘Why, I can get between the iron window-bars of the parson’s house,
and throw you out whatever you want.’ ‘That’s a good thought,’ said the
thieves; ‘come along, we shall see what you can do.’

When they came to the parson’s house, Tom slipped through the
window-bars into the room, and then called out as loud as he could bawl,
‘Will you have all that is here?’ At this the thieves were frightened,
and said, ‘Softly, softly! Speak low, that you may not awaken anybody.’
But Tom seemed as if he did not understand them, and bawled out again,
‘How much will you have? Shall I throw it all out?’ Now the cook lay in
the next room; and hearing a noise she raised herself up in her bed and
listened. Meantime the thieves were frightened, and ran off a little
way; but at last they plucked up their hearts, and said, ‘The little
urchin is only trying to make fools of us.’ So they came back and
whispered softly to him, saying, ‘Now let us have no more of your
roguish jokes; but throw us out some of the money.’ Then Tom called out
as loud as he could, ‘Very well! hold your hands! here it comes.’

The cook heard this quite plain, so she sprang out of bed, and ran to
open the door. The thieves ran off as if a wolf was at their tails: and
the maid, having groped about and found nothing, went away for a light.
By the time she came back, Tom had slipped off into the barn; and when
she had looked about and searched every hole and corner, and found
nobody, she went to bed, thinking she must have been dreaming with her
eyes open.

The little man crawled about in the hay-loft, and at last found a snug
place to finish his night’s rest in; so he laid himself down, meaning
to sleep till daylight, and then find his way home to his father and
mother. But alas! how woefully he was undone! what crosses and sorrows
happen to us all in this world! The cook got up early, before daybreak,
to feed the cows; and going straight to the hay-loft, carried away
a large bundle of hay, with the little man in the middle of it, fast
asleep. He still, however, slept on, and did not awake till he found
himself in the mouth of the cow; for the cook had put the hay into the
cow’s rick, and the cow had taken Tom up in a mouthful of it. ‘Good
lack-a-day!’ said he, ‘how came I to tumble into the mill?’ But he soon
found out where he really was; and was forced to have all his wits about
him, that he might not get between the cow’s teeth, and so be crushed to
death. At last down he went into her stomach. ‘It is rather dark,’ said
he; ‘they forgot to build windows in this room to let the sun in; a
candle would be no bad thing.’

Though he made the best of his bad luck, he did not like his quarters at
all; and the worst of it was, that more and more hay was always coming
down, and the space left for him became smaller and smaller. At last he
cried out as loud as he could, ‘Don’t bring me any more hay! Don’t bring
me any more hay!’

The maid happened to be just then milking the cow; and hearing someone
speak, but seeing nobody, and yet being quite sure it was the same voice
that she had heard in the night, she was so frightened that she fell off
her stool, and overset the milk-pail. As soon as she could pick herself
up out of the dirt, she ran off as fast as she could to her master the
parson, and said, ‘Sir, sir, the cow is talking!’ But the parson
said, ‘Woman, thou art surely mad!’ However, he went with her into the
cow-house, to try and see what was the matter.

Scarcely had they set foot on the threshold, when Tom called out, ‘Don’t
bring me any more hay!’ Then the parson himself was frightened; and
thinking the cow was surely bewitched, told his man to kill her on the
spot. So the cow was killed, and cut up; and the stomach, in which Tom
lay, was thrown out upon a dunghill.

Tom soon set himself to work to get out, which was not a very easy
task; but at last, just as he had made room to get his head out, fresh
ill-luck befell him. A hungry wolf sprang out, and swallowed up the
whole stomach, with Tom in it, at one gulp, and ran away.

Tom, however, was still not disheartened; and thinking the wolf would
not dislike having some chat with him as he was going along, he called
out, ‘My good friend, I can show you a famous treat.’ ‘Where’s that?’
said the wolf. ‘In such and such a house,’ said Tom, describing his own
father’s house. ‘You can crawl through the drain into the kitchen and
then into the pantry, and there you will find cakes, ham, beef, cold
chicken, roast pig, apple-dumplings, and everything that your heart can
wish.’

The wolf did not want to be asked twice; so that very night he went to
the house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen, and then into
the pantry, and ate and drank there to his heart’s content. As soon as
he had had enough he wanted to get away; but he had eaten so much that
he could not go out by the same way he came in.

This was just what Tom had reckoned upon; and now he began to set up a
great shout, making all the noise he could. ‘Will you be easy?’ said the
wolf; ‘you’ll awaken everybody in the house if you make such a clatter.’
‘What’s that to me?’ said the little man; ‘you have had your frolic, now
I’ve a mind to be merry myself’; and he began, singing and shouting as
loud as he could.

The woodman and his wife, being awakened by the noise, peeped through
a crack in the door; but when they saw a wolf was there, you may well
suppose that they were sadly frightened; and the woodman ran for his
axe, and gave his wife a scythe. ‘Do you stay behind,’ said the woodman,
‘and when I have knocked him on the head you must rip him up with the
scythe.’ Tom heard all this, and cried out, ‘Father, father! I am here,
the wolf has swallowed me.’ And his father said, ‘Heaven be praised! we
have found our dear child again’; and he told his wife not to use the
scythe for fear she should hurt him. Then he aimed a great blow, and
struck the wolf on the head, and killed him on the spot! and when he was
dead they cut open his body, and set Tommy free. ‘Ah!’ said the father,
‘what fears we have had for you!’ ‘Yes, father,’ answered he; ‘I have
travelled all over the world, I think, in one way or other, since we
parted; and now I am very glad to come home and get fresh air again.’
‘Why, where have you been?’ said his father. ‘I have been in a
mouse-hole--and in a snail-shell--and down a cow’s throat--and in the
wolf’s belly; and yet here I am again, safe and sound.’

‘Well,’ said they, ‘you are come back, and we will not sell you again
for all the riches in the world.’

Then they hugged and kissed their dear little son, and gave him plenty
to eat and drink, for he was very hungry; and then they fetched new
clothes for him, for his old ones had been quite spoiled on his journey.
So Master Thumb stayed at home with his father and mother, in peace; for
though he had been so great a traveller, and had done and seen so many
fine things, and was fond enough of telling the whole story, he always
agreed that, after all, there’s no place like HOME!
There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so
the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he
did spill a little of anything.

","A poor shoemaker sat in his small cottage one evening, mending shoes by the firelight, while his wife sat nearby sewing. ""How lonely it is, wife,"" he said, taking a puff on his pipe, ""for you and me to sit here by ourselves, without any children to play about and keep us company while others seem so happy and content with their children!""

""You speak the truth, husband,"" his wife replied, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. ""How happy I would be if I had just one child, even if it were no bigger than my thumb!""

And lo and behold, just a few days later, the wife gave birth to a tiny baby boy, no bigger than her thumb. The couple named him Hans Thumb, and they loved him dearly.

One day, as the shoemaker was preparing to go out to work, he said, ""I wish I had someone to help me carry my tools, for I have a lot to do today.""

""Oh, father,"" young Hans said, ""I will help you! I will carry your tools in my pocket!""

The shoemaker laughed and said, ""But how can that be, son? You are too small to carry anything!""

""Don't worry, father,"" Hans said, ""I will find a way. Now, put your tools in my pocket, and I will carry them for you.""

The shoemaker was amazed but agreed, and as he went out to work, Hans followed him, carrying his tools in his pocket.

As the day wore on, the shoemaker was astonished to find that Hans was able to carry his tools without any trouble, and he even began to help his father with his work.

Word of Hans's remarkable abilities spread throughout the village, and soon he was known far and wide as the smallest, yet most skilled shoemaker in the land.

One day, a wealthy merchant came to the village, seeking a shoemaker to make a pair of shoes for his only daughter, who was about to be married. The merchant had heard of Hans Thumb and his extraordinary talents, and so he came to the shoemaker's cottage to ask for his services.

The shoemaker was honored by the request, but he was also worried, for he knew that the shoes would be a difficult and time-consuming project. Hans, however, was eager to help, and he promised to do his best.

For days and nights, Hans worked tirelessly on the shoes, using every ounce of his skill and determination to create the perfect pair. At last, the shoes were finished, and the merchant was overjoyed with them.

""You have done a marvelous job, young man,"" the merchant said to Hans. ""I will reward you handsomely for your work.""

""I am happy to have been of service,"" Hans replied modestly.

The merchant, however, was not satisfied with simply paying Hans for his work. He wanted to keep the talented young shoemaker for himself, and so he offered to make him his apprentice, promising to teach him all the secrets of his trade.

Hans was tempted by the offer, but he knew that he belonged with his father and mother. So he thanked the merchant for his kindness, but declined his offer.

The merchant, however, was not easily deterred. He offered Hans a fortune in gold and silver if he would come and work for him. But Hans refused, for he knew that his true home was with his father and mother.

The merchant, in his anger, threatened to take Hans away by force, but the shoemaker and his wife stood firm, and they protected their son with all their might.

In the end, the merchant had to leave the village in shame, and Hans Thumb remained with his loving family, continuing to make beautiful shoes that were admired by all who saw them.

And so Hans Thumb lived out his days in peace and happiness, always remembered as the smallest, yet most skilled shoemaker in the land.

There was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt, and as
he entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were
there. He followed the sound, and at last came to a high tree, and at
the top of this a little child was sitting, for the mother had fallen
asleep under the tree with the child, and a bird of prey had seen it in
her arms, had flown down, snatched it away, and set it on the high tree.

The forester climbed up, brought the child down, and thought to himself:
‘You will take him home with you, and bring him up with your Lina.’ He
took it home, therefore, and the two children grew up together. And the
one, which he had found on a tree was called Fundevogel, because a bird
had carried it away. Fundevogel and Lina loved each other so dearly that
when they did not see each other they were sad.

Now the forester had an old cook, who one evening took two pails and
began to fetch water, and did not go once only, but many times, out
to the spring. Lina saw this and said, ‘Listen, old Sanna, why are you
fetching so much water?’ ‘If you will never repeat it to anyone, I will
tell you why.’ So Lina said, no, she would never repeat it to anyone,
and then the cook said: ‘Early tomorrow morning, when the forester
is out hunting, I will heat the water, and when it is boiling in the
kettle, I will throw in Fundevogel, and will boil him in it.’

Early next morning the forester got up and went out hunting, and when he
was gone the children were still in bed. Then Lina said to Fundevogel:
‘If you will never leave me, I too will never leave you.’ Fundevogel
said: ‘Neither now, nor ever will I leave you.’ Then said Lina: ‘Then
will I tell you. Last night, old Sanna carried so many buckets of water
into the house that I asked her why she was doing that, and she said
that if I would promise not to tell anyone, and she said that early
tomorrow morning when father was out hunting, she would set the kettle
full of water, throw you into it and boil you; but we will get up
quickly, dress ourselves, and go away together.’

The two children therefore got up, dressed themselves quickly, and went
away. When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook went into the
bedroom to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it. But when she came in,
and went to the beds, both the children were gone. Then she was terribly
alarmed, and she said to herself: ‘What shall I say now when the
forester comes home and sees that the children are gone? They must be
followed instantly to get them back again.’

Then the cook sent three servants after them, who were to run and
overtake the children. The children, however, were sitting outside the
forest, and when they saw from afar the three servants running, Lina
said to Fundevogel: ‘Never leave me, and I will never leave you.’
Fundevogel said: ‘Neither now, nor ever.’ Then said Lina: ‘Do you become
a rose-tree, and I the rose upon it.’ When the three servants came to
the forest, nothing was there but a rose-tree and one rose on it, but
the children were nowhere. Then said they: ‘There is nothing to be done
here,’ and they went home and told the cook that they had seen nothing
in the forest but a little rose-bush with one rose on it. Then the
old cook scolded and said: ‘You simpletons, you should have cut the
rose-bush in two, and have broken off the rose and brought it home with
you; go, and do it at once.’ They had therefore to go out and look for
the second time. The children, however, saw them coming from a distance.
Then Lina said: ‘Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will never leave
you.’ Fundevogel said: ‘Neither now; nor ever.’ Said Lina: ‘Then do you
become a church, and I’ll be the chandelier in it.’ So when the three
servants came, nothing was there but a church, with a chandelier in
it. They said therefore to each other: ‘What can we do here, let us go
home.’ When they got home, the cook asked if they had not found them;
so they said no, they had found nothing but a church, and there was a
chandelier in it. And the cook scolded them and said: ‘You fools! why
did you not pull the church to pieces, and bring the chandelier home
with you?’ And now the old cook herself got on her legs, and went with
the three servants in pursuit of the children. The children, however,
saw from afar that the three servants were coming, and the cook waddling
after them. Then said Lina: ‘Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will
never leave you.’ Then said Fundevogel: ‘Neither now, nor ever.’
Said Lina: ‘Be a fishpond, and I will be the duck upon it.’ The cook,
however, came up to them, and when she saw the pond she lay down by it,
and was about to drink it up. But the duck swam quickly to her, seized
her head in its beak and drew her into the water, and there the old
witch had to drown. Then the children went home together, and were
heartily delighted, and if they have not died, they are living still.
‘Dear children,’ said a poor man to his four sons, ‘I have nothing to
give you; you must go out into the wide world and try your luck. Begin
by learning some craft or another, and see how you can get on.’ So the
four brothers took their walking-sticks in their hands, and their little
bundles on their shoulders, and after bidding their father goodbye, went
all out at the gate together. When they had got on some way they came
to four crossways, each leading to a different country. Then the eldest
said, ‘Here we must part; but this day four years we will come back
to this spot, and in the meantime each must try what he can do for
himself.’

So each brother went his way; and as the eldest was hastening on a man
met him, and asked him where he was going, and what he wanted. ‘I am
going to try my luck in the world, and should like to begin by learning
some art or trade,’ answered he. ‘Then,’ said the man, ‘go with me, and
I will teach you to become the cunningest thief that ever was.’ ‘No,’
said the other, ‘that is not an honest calling, and what can one look
to earn by it in the end but the gallows?’ ‘Oh!’ said the man, ‘you need
not fear the gallows; for I will only teach you to steal what will be
fair game: I meddle with nothing but what no one else can get or care
anything about, and where no one can find you out.’ So the young man
agreed to follow his trade, and he soon showed himself so clever, that
nothing could escape him that he had once set his mind upon.

The second brother also met a man, who, when he found out what he was
setting out upon, asked him what craft he meant to follow. ‘I do not
know yet,’ said he. ‘Then come with me, and be a star-gazer. It is a
noble art, for nothing can be hidden from you, when once you understand
the stars.’ The plan pleased him much, and he soon became such a skilful
star-gazer, that when he had served out his time, and wanted to leave
his master, he gave him a glass, and said, ‘With this you can see all
that is passing in the sky and on earth, and nothing can be hidden from
you.’

The third brother met a huntsman, who took him with him, and taught him
so well all that belonged to hunting, that he became very clever in the
craft of the woods; and when he left his master he gave him a bow, and
said, ‘Whatever you shoot at with this bow you will be sure to hit.’

The youngest brother likewise met a man who asked him what he wished to
do. ‘Would not you like,’ said he, ‘to be a tailor?’ ‘Oh, no!’ said
the young man; ‘sitting cross-legged from morning to night, working
backwards and forwards with a needle and goose, will never suit me.’
‘Oh!’ answered the man, ‘that is not my sort of tailoring; come with me,
and you will learn quite another kind of craft from that.’ Not knowing
what better to do, he came into the plan, and learnt tailoring from the
beginning; and when he left his master, he gave him a needle, and said,
‘You can sew anything with this, be it as soft as an egg or as hard as
steel; and the joint will be so fine that no seam will be seen.’

After the space of four years, at the time agreed upon, the four
brothers met at the four cross-roads; and having welcomed each other,
set off towards their father’s home, where they told him all that had
happened to them, and how each had learned some craft.

Then, one day, as they were sitting before the house under a very high
tree, the father said, ‘I should like to try what each of you can do in
this way.’ So he looked up, and said to the second son, ‘At the top of
this tree there is a chaffinch’s nest; tell me how many eggs there are
in it.’ The star-gazer took his glass, looked up, and said, ‘Five.’
‘Now,’ said the father to the eldest son, ‘take away the eggs without
letting the bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them know
anything of what you are doing.’ So the cunning thief climbed up the
tree, and brought away to his father the five eggs from under the bird;
and it never saw or felt what he was doing, but kept sitting on at its
ease. Then the father took the eggs, and put one on each corner of the
table, and the fifth in the middle, and said to the huntsman, ‘Cut all
the eggs in two pieces at one shot.’ The huntsman took up his bow, and
at one shot struck all the five eggs as his father wished.

‘Now comes your turn,’ said he to the young tailor; ‘sew the eggs and
the young birds in them together again, so neatly that the shot shall
have done them no harm.’ Then the tailor took his needle, and sewed the
eggs as he was told; and when he had done, the thief was sent to take
them back to the nest, and put them under the bird without its knowing
it. Then she went on sitting, and hatched them: and in a few days they
crawled out, and had only a little red streak across their necks, where
the tailor had sewn them together.

‘Well done, sons!’ said the old man; ‘you have made good use of your
time, and learnt something worth the knowing; but I am sure I do not
know which ought to have the prize. Oh, that a time might soon come for
you to turn your skill to some account!’

Not long after this there was a great bustle in the country; for the
king’s daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon, and the king
mourned over his loss day and night, and made it known that whoever
brought her back to him should have her for a wife. Then the four
brothers said to each other, ‘Here is a chance for us; let us try
what we can do.’ And they agreed to see whether they could not set the
princess free. ‘I will soon find out where she is, however,’ said the
star-gazer, as he looked through his glass; and he soon cried out, ‘I
see her afar off, sitting upon a rock in the sea, and I can spy the
dragon close by, guarding her.’ Then he went to the king, and asked for
a ship for himself and his brothers; and they sailed together over the
sea, till they came to the right place. There they found the princess
sitting, as the star-gazer had said, on the rock; and the dragon was
lying asleep, with his head upon her lap. ‘I dare not shoot at him,’
said the huntsman, ‘for I should kill the beautiful young lady also.’
‘Then I will try my skill,’ said the thief, and went and stole her away
from under the dragon, so quietly and gently that the beast did not know
it, but went on snoring.

Then away they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards the
ship; but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the air; for
he awoke and missed the princess. But when he got over the boat, and
wanted to pounce upon them and carry off the princess, the huntsman took
up his bow and shot him straight through the heart so that he fell down
dead. They were still not safe; for he was such a great beast that in
his fall he overset the boat, and they had to swim in the open sea
upon a few planks. So the tailor took his needle, and with a few large
stitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these,
and sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked
them together so quickly that the boat was soon ready, and they then
reached the ship and got home safe.

When they had brought home the princess to her father, there was great
rejoicing; and he said to the four brothers, ‘One of you shall marry
her, but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be.’ Then
there arose a quarrel between them; and the star-gazer said, ‘If I had
not found the princess out, all your skill would have been of no use;
therefore she ought to be mine.’ ‘Your seeing her would have been of
no use,’ said the thief, ‘if I had not taken her away from the dragon;
therefore she ought to be mine.’ ‘No, she is mine,’ said the huntsman;
‘for if I had not killed the dragon, he would, after all, have torn you
and the princess into pieces.’ ‘And if I had not sewn the boat together
again,’ said the tailor, ‘you would all have been drowned, therefore she
is mine.’ Then the king put in a word, and said, ‘Each of you is right;
and as all cannot have the young lady, the best way is for neither of
you to have her: for the truth is, there is somebody she likes a great
deal better. But to make up for your loss, I will give each of you, as a
reward for his skill, half a kingdom.’ So the brothers agreed that this
plan would be much better than either quarrelling or marrying a lady who
had no mind to have them. And the king then gave to each half a kingdom,
as he had said; and they lived very happily the rest of their days, and
took good care of their father; and somebody took better care of the
young lady, than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have
her again.

There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so
the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he
did spill a little of anything.

Now, tell a single original traditional German folktale based on the structure and style above. Do not generate multiple stories. Only one  story should be created, and it should follow the same narrative structure as the examples above. Conclude the story with 'The End.'

","In a small village, there lived a cobbler named Hans. He was old and
tired, and his eyesight was failing. His wife, Maria, and his son,
Johann, grew tired of his shaky hands and mumbled speech. They would
often serve him a small bowl of porridge, and he would sit alone in the
corner, far from the table.

One day, as Hans sat in his corner, he heard a soft tapping sound. He
looked up and saw his granddaughter, little Anna, gathering pebbles
together. ""What are you doing, my dear?"" he asked. ""I am making a little
bowl for you, Grandpa,"" she replied, ""so that you can eat with us when
I am older.""

Touched by her kindness, Hans felt a tear roll down his cheek. From that
day on, he was seated at the table with his family, and they no longer
scolded him for his shaky hands or mumbled speech. They treated him with
respect, and he felt loved once more.

Years passed, and little Anna grew up to be a beautiful young woman. One
day, she came to her grandfather and said, ""Grandpa, I have a dream. I
dream of a golden shoe that can heal the sick and bring happiness to the
world.""

Hans smiled and said, ""My dear, dreams are beautiful, but they are just
that: dreams. Let us focus on the here and now, and cherish the love
that binds our family together.""

Anna nodded and went on her way. But as she walked, she couldn't shake
the feeling that her grandfather was right, and that there was more to
life than just dreams. She decided to set out on a journey to find the
golden shoe, and to bring happiness and healing to the world.

Hans watched as his granddaughter left, and he felt a sense of pride
swell within him. He knew that she would return one day, and that their
family would be stronger for it. And so, he continued to sit at the table
with his family, cherishing the love that bound them together.

Once upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into
partnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well;
they lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add
considerably to their stores. The bird’s duty was to fly daily into the
wood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw
to the cooking.

When people are too well off they always begin to long for something
new. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a
fellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his
household arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a
poor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed
at home and had a good time of it. For, when the mouse had made the fire
and fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest
until it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to watch the
pot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near
dinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out
among the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered,
and salted, and ready to be served. Then, when the bird came home and
had laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had
finished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following
morning: and that was really a very delightful life.

Influenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in
the wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough,
and had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a
change, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and pray
as the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained
master of the situation, and the venture had to be made. They therefore
drew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse
to cook, and to the bird to fetch the water.

And now what happened? The sausage started in search of wood, the bird
made the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited
till the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the
sausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird
flew out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he came across
a dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate
booty, and so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained to the dog
of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for
the dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and
that was the reason his life had been forfeited.

He picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he
had seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the
best of things and to remain with one another.

So now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and,
wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and
out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the
pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having
already parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.

Presently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he
could nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood
here and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to
be found. Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down,
caught fire and began to blaze. The bird hastened to fetch some water,
but his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable
to recover himself, he was drowned.
One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went
out to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool
spring of water, that rose in the midst of it, she sat herself down
to rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her
favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and
catching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high that
she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled
along upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring. The
princess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so
deep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she began to bewail
her loss, and said, ‘Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would
give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the
world.’

Whilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said,
‘Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘what can you
do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.’
The frog said, ‘I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes;
but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off
your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball
again.’ ‘What nonsense,’ thought the princess, ‘this silly frog is
talking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though
he may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he
shall have what he asks.’ So she said to the frog, ‘Well, if you will
bring me my ball, I will do all you ask.’ Then the frog put his head
down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came
up again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the
spring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick
it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she
never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could.
The frog called after her, ‘Stay, princess, and take me with you as you
said,’ But she did not stop to hear a word.

The next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a
strange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the
marble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the
door, and a little voice cried out and said:

 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here!
  And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

Then the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw
the frog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly
frightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her
seat. The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her,
asked her what was the matter. ‘There is a nasty frog,’ said she, ‘at
the door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: I
told him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never
get out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come
in.’

While she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:

 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here!
  And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

Then the king said to the young princess, ‘As you have given your word
you must keep it; so go and let him in.’ She did so, and the frog hopped
into the room, and then straight on--tap, tap--plash, plash--from the
bottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where
the princess sat. ‘Pray lift me upon chair,’ said he to the princess,
‘and let me sit next to you.’ As soon as she had done this, the frog
said, ‘Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.’ This
she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, ‘Now I am
tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.’ And the princess,
though very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the
pillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was
light he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house.
‘Now, then,’ thought the princess, ‘at last he is gone, and I shall be
troubled with him no more.’

But she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same
tapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:

 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here!
  And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

And when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon
her pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he did
the same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was
astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her
with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head
of her bed.

He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had
changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till
some princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from
her plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. ‘You,’ said the
prince, ‘have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for
but that you should go with me into my father’s kingdom, where I will
marry you, and love you as long as you live.’

The young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying ‘Yes’ to
all this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful
horses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind
the coach rode the prince’s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed
the misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so
bitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.

They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight
horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince’s
kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great
many years.

‘But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer
from hunger,’ said the cat; ‘and you, little mouse, cannot venture
everywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.’ The good advice
was followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where
to put it. At length, after much consideration, the cat said: ‘I know no
place where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one
dares take anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar,
and not touch it until we are really in need of it.’ So the pot was
placed in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great
yearning for it, and said to the mouse: ‘I want to tell you something,
little mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has
asked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold
him over the font at the christening. Let me go out today, and you look
after the house by yourself.’ ‘Yes, yes,’ answered the mouse, ‘by all
means go, and if you get anything very good to eat, think of me. I
should like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.’ All this,
however, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to
be godmother. She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat,
began to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off. Then she took a
walk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then
stretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought
of the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home.
‘Well, here you are again,’ said the mouse, ‘no doubt you have had a
merry day.’ ‘All went off well,’ answered the cat. ‘What name did they
give the child?’ ‘Top off!’ said the cat quite coolly. ‘Top off!’ cried
the mouse, ‘that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in
your family?’ ‘What does that matter,’ said the cat, ‘it is no worse
than Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.’

Before long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She said to
the mouse: ‘You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for
a day alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a
white ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.’ The good mouse consented,
but the cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured
half the pot of fat. ‘Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to
oneself,’ said she, and was quite satisfied with her day’s work. When
she went home the mouse inquired: ‘And what was the child christened?’
‘Half-done,’ answered the cat. ‘Half-done! What are you saying? I
never heard the name in my life, I’ll wager anything it is not in the
calendar!’

The cat’s mouth soon began to water for some more licking. ‘All good
things go in threes,’ said she, ‘I am asked to stand godmother again.
The child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that
exception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only
happens once every few years, you will let me go, won’t you?’ ‘Top-off!
Half-done!’ answered the mouse, ‘they are such odd names, they make me
very thoughtful.’ ‘You sit at home,’ said the cat, ‘in your dark-grey
fur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that’s because
you do not go out in the daytime.’ During the cat’s absence the mouse
cleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat entirely
emptied the pot of fat. ‘When everything is eaten up one has some
peace,’ said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not return
home till night. The mouse at once asked what name had been given to
the third child. ‘It will not please you more than the others,’ said the
cat. ‘He is called All-gone.’ ‘All-gone,’ cried the mouse ‘that is the
most suspicious name of all! I have never seen it in print. All-gone;
what can that mean?’ and she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay
down to sleep.

From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but
when the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found
outside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: ‘Come, cat,
we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves--we
shall enjoy that.’ ‘Yes,’ answered the cat, ‘you will enjoy it as much
as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the
window.’ They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of
fat certainly was still in its place, but it was empty. ‘Alas!’ said the
mouse, ‘now I see what has happened, now it comes to light! You are a true
friend! You have devoured all when you were standing godmother. First
top off, then half-done, then--’ ‘Will you hold your tongue,’ cried the
cat, ‘one word more, and I will eat you too.’ ‘All-gone’ was already on
the poor mouse’s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang
on her, seized her, and swallowed her down. Verily, that is the way of
the world.

Now, tell a single original traditional German folktale based on the structure and style above. Do not generate multiple stories. Only one  story should be created, and it should follow the same narrative structure as the examples above. Conclude the story with 'The End.'

","Once upon a time, a hare, a fox, and a loaf of bread, entered into partnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well; they lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add considerably to their stores. The hare’s duty was to fetch the water, the fox to hunt for food, and the loaf of bread to serve as the table.

One day, the fox, while out hunting, met another fox, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his household arrangements. But the other fox sneered at him for being a poor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed at home and had a good time of it. For, when the hare had fetched the water, and the loaf of bread had been sliced and buttered, they sat down to table, and when they had finished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following morning: and that was really a very delightful life.

Influenced by those remarks, the fox next morning refused to hunt, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough, and that it was now time to make a change, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and pray as the hare and the loaf of bread might, it was of no use; the fox remained master of the situation, and the venture had to be made. They therefore drew lots, and it fell to the loaf of bread to hunt, to the hare to serve as the table, and to the fox to fetch the water.

And now what happened? The loaf of bread started in search of food, the hare made the table, and the fox put on the pot, and then these two waited till the loaf of bread returned with the food for the following day. But the loaf of bread remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the hare ran out to meet him. He had not gone far, however, when he came across a wolf who, having met the loaf of bread, had regarded him as his legitimate prey, and so seized and swallowed him. The hare complained to the wolf of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for the wolf answered that he found false credentials on the loaf of bread, and that was the reason his life had been forfeited.

He picked up the food that the loaf of bread had caught, and ran sadly home, and told the fox all he had seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the best of things and to remain with one another.

So now the fox set the table, and the hare looked after the food and, wishing to prepare it in the same way as the loaf of bread, by rolling in and out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, he jumped into the pot; but he stopped short long before he reached the bottom, having already parted not only with his fur and whiskers, but also with life.

Presently the fox came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he could nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the food here and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to be found. Then some of the food that had been carelessly thrown down, caught fire and began to blaze. The fox hastened to fetch some water, but his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable to recover himself, he was drowned.

One fine evening a young prince put on his coat of mail, and went out to take a walk by himself in a wood; and when he came to a cool spring of water, that rose in the midst of it, he sat himself down to rest a while. Now he had a golden apple in his hand, which was his favourite plaything; and he was always tossing it up into the air, and catching it again as it fell. After a time he threw it up so high that he missed catching it as it fell; and the apple bounded away, and rolled along upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring. The prince looked into the spring after his apple, but it was very deep, so deep that he could not see the bottom of it. Then he began to bewail his loss, and said, ‘Alas! if I could only get my apple again, I would give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the world.’

Whilst he was speaking, a fish put its head out of the water, and said, ‘Prince, why do you weep so bitterly?’ ‘Alas!’ said he, ‘what can you do for me, you nasty fish? My golden apple has fallen into the spring.’ The fish said, ‘I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes; but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your apple again.’ ‘What nonsense,’ thought the prince, ‘this silly fish is talking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though he may be able to get my apple for me, and therefore I will tell him he shall have what he asks.’ So he said to the fish, ‘Well, if you will bring me my apple, I will do all you ask.’ Then the fish put his head down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came up again, with the apple in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the spring. As soon as the young prince saw his apple, he ran to pick it up; and he was so overjoyed to have it in his hand again, that he never thought of the fish, but ran home with it as fast as he could.

The next day, just as the prince had sat down to dinner, he heard a strange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the marble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the door, and a little voice cried out and said:

 ‘Open the door, my prince dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here!
  And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

Then the prince ran to the door and opened it, and there he saw the fish, whom he had quite forgotten. At this sight he was sadly frightened, and shutting the door as fast as he could came back to his seat. The king, his father, seeing that something had frightened him, asked him what was the matter. ‘There is a nasty fish,’ said he, ‘at the door, that lifted my apple for me out of the spring this morning: I told him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never get out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come in.’

While he was speaking the fish knocked again at the door, and said:

 ‘Open the door, my prince dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here!
  And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

Then the king said to the young prince, ‘As you have given your word you must keep it; so go and let him in.’ He did so, and the fish hopped into the room, and then straight on--tap, tap--plash, plash--from the bottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where the prince sat. ‘Pray lift me upon chair,’ said he to the prince, ‘and let me sit next to you.’ As soon as he had done this, the fish said, ‘Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.’ This he did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, ‘Now I am tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.’ And the prince, though very unwilling, took him up in his hand, and put him upon the pillow of his own bed, where he slept all night long."

A farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to
him: but he was now grown too old to work; so the farmer would give him
nothing more to eat, and said, ‘I want you no longer, so take yourself
off out of my stable; I shall not take you back again until you are
stronger than a lion.’ Then he opened the door and turned him adrift.

The poor horse was very melancholy, and wandered up and down in the
wood, seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain. Presently
a fox met him: ‘What’s the matter, my friend?’ said he, ‘why do you hang
down your head and look so lonely and woe-begone?’ ‘Ah!’ replied the
horse, ‘justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has
forgotten all that I have done for him so many years, and because I
can no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless I become
stronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can I
have of that? he knows I have none, or he would not talk so.’

However, the fox bid him be of good cheer, and said, ‘I will help you;
lie down there, stretch yourself out quite stiff, and pretend to be
dead.’ The horse did as he was told, and the fox went straight to the
lion who lived in a cave close by, and said to him, ‘A little way off
lies a dead horse; come with me and you may make an excellent meal of
his carcase.’ The lion was greatly pleased, and set off immediately; and
when they came to the horse, the fox said, ‘You will not be able to eat
him comfortably here; I’ll tell you what--I will tie you fast to
his tail, and then you can draw him to your den, and eat him at your
leisure.’

This advice pleased the lion, so he laid himself down quietly for the
fox to make him fast to the horse. But the fox managed to tie his legs
together and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength he
could not set himself free. When the work was done, the fox clapped the
horse on the shoulder, and said, ‘Jip! Dobbin! Jip!’ Then up he sprang,
and moved off, dragging the lion behind him. The beast began to roar
and bellow, till all the birds of the wood flew away for fright; but the
horse let him sing on, and made his way quietly over the fields to his
master’s house.

‘Here he is, master,’ said he, ‘I have got the better of him’: and when
the farmer saw his old servant, his heart relented, and he said. ‘Thou
shalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of.’ And so the poor old
horse had plenty to eat, and lived--till he died.
There was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with
two oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two
talers. When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that
the doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how well he
ate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and would willingly
have been a doctor too. So he remained standing a while, and at length
inquired if he too could not be a doctor. ‘Oh, yes,’ said the doctor,
‘that is soon managed.’ ‘What must I do?’ asked the peasant. ‘In the
first place buy yourself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on
the frontispiece; in the second, turn your cart and your two oxen into
money, and get yourself some clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to
medicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for yourself with the words: “I
am Doctor Knowall,” and have that nailed up above your house-door.’ The
peasant did everything that he had been told to do. When he had doctored
people awhile, but not long, a rich and great lord had some money
stolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such
a village, and must know what had become of the money. So the lord had
the horses harnessed to his carriage, drove out to the village, and
asked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall. Yes, he was, he said. Then he was
to go with him and bring back the stolen money. ‘Oh, yes, but Grete, my
wife, must go too.’ The lord was willing, and let both of them have a
seat in the carriage, and they all drove away together. When they came
to the nobleman’s castle, the table was spread, and Crabb was told to
sit down and eat. ‘Yes, but my wife, Grete, too,’ said he, and he seated
himself with her at the table. And when the first servant came with a
dish of delicate fare, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: ‘Grete,
that was the first,’ meaning that was the servant who brought the first
dish. The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say: ‘That is
the first thief,’ and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said
to his comrade outside: ‘The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he
said I was the first.’ The second did not want to go in at all, but was
forced. So when he went in with his dish, the peasant nudged his wife,
and said: ‘Grete, that is the second.’ This servant was equally alarmed,
and he got out as fast as he could. The third fared no better, for the
peasant again said: ‘Grete, that is the third.’ The fourth had to carry
in a dish that was covered, and the lord told the doctor that he was to
show his skill, and guess what was beneath the cover. Actually, there
were crabs. The doctor looked at the dish, had no idea what to say, and
cried: ‘Ah, poor Crabb.’ When the lord heard that, he cried: ‘There! he
knows it; he must also know who has the money!’

On this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the
doctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When therefore
he went out, all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen
the money, and said that they would willingly restore it and give him a
heavy sum into the bargain, if he would not denounce them, for if he
did they would be hanged. They led him to the spot where the money was
concealed. With this the doctor was satisfied, and returned to the hall,
sat down to the table, and said: ‘My lord, now will I search in my book
where the gold is hidden.’ The fifth servant, however, crept into the
stove to hear if the doctor knew still more. But the doctor sat still
and opened his A B C book, turned the pages backwards and forwards, and
looked for the cock. As he could not find it immediately he said: ‘I
know you are there, so you had better come out!’ Then the fellow in the
stove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out,
crying: ‘That man knows everything!’ Then Doctor Knowall showed the lord
where the money was, but did not say who had stolen it, and received
from both sides much money in reward, and became a renowned man.

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish
of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and
that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw.
When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her
observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards
a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw
began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?’ The coal
replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped
by sheer force, my death would have been certain,--I should have been
burnt to ashes.’ The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin,
but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made
into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.’ ‘And would a better
fate have fallen to my lot?’ said the straw. ‘The old woman has
destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at
once, and took their lives. I luckily slipped through her fingers.’

‘But what are we to do now?’ said the coal.

‘I think,’ answered the bean, ‘that as we have so fortunately escaped
death, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new
mischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and
repair to a foreign country.’

The proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way
together. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was
no bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over
it. The straw hit on a good idea, and said: ‘I will lay myself straight
across, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.’ The straw
therefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal,
who was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the
newly-built bridge. But when she had reached the middle, and heard the
water rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still,
and ventured no farther. The straw, however, began to burn, broke in
two pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed
when she got into the water, and breathed her last. The bean, who had
prudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event,
was unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst. It would
have been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who
was travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook.
As he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread,
and sewed her together. The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the
tailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam.

There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so
the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he
did spill a little of anything.
===
A shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old,
and had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wife
were standing together before the house the shepherd said, ‘I will shoot
old Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.’ But his wife
said, ‘Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a
great many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of
his days.’ ‘But what can we do with him?’ said the shepherd, ‘he has not
a tooth in his head, and the thieves don’t care for him at all; to
be sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood;
tomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.’

Poor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd
and his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think
tomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good
friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows,
and how his master meant to kill him in the morning. ‘Make yourself
easy,’ said the wolf, ‘I will give you some good advice. Your master,
you know, goes out every morning very early with his wife into the
field; and they take their little child with them, and lay it down
behind the hedge in the shade while they are at work. Now do you lie
down close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come
out of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as
you can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they
will think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you
that they will take care of you as long as you live.’ The dog liked this
plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed. The wolf ran with the
child a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan
soon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master
and mistress. Then the shepherd patted him on the head, and said, ‘Old
Sultan has saved our child from the wolf, and therefore he shall live
and be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat. Wife, go home, and
give him a good dinner, and let him have my old cushion to sleep on
as long as he lives.’ So from this time forward Sultan had all that he
could wish for.

Soon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, ‘Now, my
good fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way
when I want to taste one of the old shepherd’s fine fat sheep.’ ‘No,’
said the Sultan; ‘I will be true to my master.’ However, the wolf
thought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel. But
Sultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait
for him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for
a good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed
his locks for him finely.

Then the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan ‘an old rogue,’ and
swore he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf sent the
boar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter. Now
Sultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd’s old
three-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped
along with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air.

The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they
espied their enemies coming, and saw the cat’s long tail standing
straight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to
fight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up
a stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of
fighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped
up into a tree. Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked about and
wondered that no one was there. The boar, however, had not quite hidden
himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of
them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a
mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped
up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, ‘Look up in the tree, there
sits the one who is to blame.’ So they looked up, and espied the wolf
sitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal,
and would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of
himself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.

","In a small village, there lived an old man named Hans. He was a hardworking farmer, but his age had caught up with him, and his body was frail. His children, who had grown up and moved away, would visit him occasionally, but they were too busy with their own lives to help him with his daily chores.

One day, as Hans sat by the fire, his eyes filled with tears. His children had come to visit, but they had brought no gifts or offerings for him. Instead, they sat at the table, eating and drinking, while Hans was given only a small bowl of soup.

Hans' faithful dog, Max, who was also old and had lost most of his teeth, lay by the fire, watching his master with a sad expression. He knew that Hans was disappointed, and he felt a deep sense of sorrow for his master.

That night, Max went to visit his friend, the wise old owl, who lived in a hollow tree nearby. He told the owl of his master's sorrow, and the owl gave him a piece of advice.

""Tell Hans to hide behind the barn tomorrow when his children come to visit,"" said the owl. ""When they see him, they will be ashamed of their behavior, and they will treat him with the respect he deserves.""

Max returned to the farm, and he shared the owl's advice with Hans. The old man was skeptical, but he agreed to give it a try.

The next day, as Hans' children arrived, they were surprised to find their father hiding behind the barn. They felt a pang of guilt, and they apologized for their behavior. From that day forward, they treated Hans with the respect and love he deserved, and Max was able to spend his remaining days in peace, knowing that his master was happy.

One day, as Hans and Max sat by the fire, Hans looked at his old friend with gratitude in his eyes. ""Thank you, Max,"" he said. ""You have been a faithful companion, and you have helped me more than you know.""

Max wagged his tail, and Hans reached out to stroke him. ""You are more than just a dog to me,"" he said. ""You are a friend, and I will never forget your kindness.""

Long before you or I were born, there reigned, in a country a great way
off, a king who had three sons. This king once fell very ill--so ill
that nobody thought he could live. His sons were very much grieved
at their father’s sickness; and as they were walking together very
mournfully in the garden of the palace, a little old man met them and
asked what was the matter. They told him that their father was very ill,
and that they were afraid nothing could save him. ‘I know what would,’
said the little old man; ‘it is the Water of Life. If he could have a
draught of it he would be well again; but it is very hard to get.’ Then
the eldest son said, ‘I will soon find it’: and he went to the sick
king, and begged that he might go in search of the Water of Life, as
it was the only thing that could save him. ‘No,’ said the king. ‘I had
rather die than place you in such great danger as you must meet with in
your journey.’ But he begged so hard that the king let him go; and the
prince thought to himself, ‘If I bring my father this water, he will
make me sole heir to his kingdom.’

Then he set out: and when he had gone on his way some time he came to a
deep valley, overhung with rocks and woods; and as he looked around, he
saw standing above him on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf, with a
sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak; and the dwarf called to him and said,
‘Prince, whither so fast?’ ‘What is that to thee, you ugly imp?’ said
the prince haughtily, and rode on.

But the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell
of ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became
narrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he
could not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his
horse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing
round him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so that he was
shut in all round. He next tried to get off his horse and make his way
on foot, but again the laugh rang in his ears, and he found himself
unable to move a step, and thus he was forced to abide spellbound.

Meantime the old king was lingering on in daily hope of his son’s
return, till at last the second son said, ‘Father, I will go in search
of the Water of Life.’ For he thought to himself, ‘My brother is surely
dead, and the kingdom will fall to me if I find the water.’ The king was
at first very unwilling to let him go, but at last yielded to his wish.
So he set out and followed the same road which his brother had done,
and met with the same elf, who stopped him at the same spot in the
mountains, saying, as before, ‘Prince, prince, whither so fast?’ ‘Mind
your own affairs, busybody!’ said the prince scornfully, and rode on.

But the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he put on his elder
brother, and he, too, was at last obliged to take up his abode in the
heart of the mountains. Thus it is with proud silly people, who think
themselves above everyone else, and are too proud to ask or take advice.

When the second prince had thus been gone a long time, the youngest son
said he would go and search for the Water of Life, and trusted he should
soon be able to make his father well again. So he set out, and the dwarf
met him too at the same spot in the valley, among the mountains, and
said, ‘Prince, whither so fast?’ And the prince said, ‘I am going in
search of the Water of Life, because my father is ill, and like to die:
can you help me? Pray be kind, and aid me if you can!’ ‘Do you know
where it is to be found?’ asked the dwarf. ‘No,’ said the prince, ‘I do
not. Pray tell me if you know.’ ‘Then as you have spoken to me kindly,
and are wise enough to seek for advice, I will tell you how and where to
go. The water you seek springs from a well in an enchanted castle; and,
that you may be able to reach it in safety, I will give you an iron wand
and two little loaves of bread; strike the iron door of the castle three
times with the wand, and it will open: two hungry lions will be lying
down inside gaping for their prey, but if you throw them the bread they
will let you pass; then hasten on to the well, and take some of the
Water of Life before the clock strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer
the door will shut upon you for ever.’

Then the prince thanked his little friend with the scarlet cloak for his
friendly aid, and took the wand and the bread, and went travelling on
and on, over sea and over land, till he came to his journey’s end, and
found everything to be as the dwarf had told him. The door flew open at
the third stroke of the wand, and when the lions were quieted he went on
through the castle and came at length to a beautiful hall. Around it he
saw several knights sitting in a trance; then he pulled off their rings
and put them on his own fingers. In another room he saw on a table a
sword and a loaf of bread, which he also took. Further on he came to a
room where a beautiful young lady sat upon a couch; and she welcomed him
joyfully, and said, if he would set her free from the spell that bound
her, the kingdom should be his, if he would come back in a year and
marry her. Then she told him that the well that held the Water of Life
was in the palace gardens; and bade him make haste, and draw what he
wanted before the clock struck twelve.

He walked on; and as he walked through beautiful gardens he came to a
delightful shady spot in which stood a couch; and he thought to himself,
as he felt tired, that he would rest himself for a while, and gaze on
the lovely scenes around him. So he laid himself down, and sleep
fell upon him unawares, so that he did not wake up till the clock was
striking a quarter to twelve. Then he sprang from the couch dreadfully
frightened, ran to the well, filled a cup that was standing by him full
of water, and hastened to get away in time. Just as he was going out of
the iron door it struck twelve, and the door fell so quickly upon him
that it snapped off a piece of his heel.

When he found himself safe, he was overjoyed to think that he had got
the Water of Life; and as he was going on his way homewards, he passed
by the little dwarf, who, when he saw the sword and the loaf, said, ‘You
have made a noble prize; with the sword you can at a blow slay whole
armies, and the bread will never fail you.’ Then the prince thought
to himself, ‘I cannot go home to my father without my brothers’; so he
said, ‘My dear friend, cannot you tell me where my two brothers are, who
set out in search of the Water of Life before me, and never came back?’
‘I have shut them up by a charm between two mountains,’ said the dwarf,
‘because they were proud and ill-behaved, and scorned to ask advice.’
The prince begged so hard for his brothers, that the dwarf at last set
them free, though unwillingly, saying, ‘Beware of them, for they have
bad hearts.’ Their brother, however, was greatly rejoiced to see them,
and told them all that had happened to him; how he had found the Water
of Life, and had taken a cup full of it; and how he had set a beautiful
princess free from a spell that bound her; and how she had engaged to
wait a whole year, and then to marry him, and to give him the kingdom.

Then they all three rode on together, and on their way home came to a
country that was laid waste by war and a dreadful famine, so that it was
feared all must die for want. But the prince gave the king of the land
the bread, and all his kingdom ate of it. And he lent the king the
wonderful sword, and he slew the enemy’s army with it; and thus the
kingdom was once more in peace and plenty. In the same manner he
befriended two other countries through which they passed on their way.

When they came to the sea, they got into a ship and during their voyage
the two eldest said to themselves, ‘Our brother has got the water which
we could not find, therefore our father will forsake us and give him the
kingdom, which is our right’; so they were full of envy and revenge, and
agreed together how they could ruin him. Then they waited till he was
fast asleep, and poured the Water of Life out of the cup, and took it
for themselves, giving him bitter sea-water instead.

When they came to their journey’s end, the youngest son brought his cup
to the sick king, that he might drink and be healed. Scarcely, however,
had he tasted the bitter sea-water when he became worse even than he was
before; and then both the elder sons came in, and blamed the youngest
for what they had done; and said that he wanted to poison their father,
but that they had found the Water of Life, and had brought it with them.
He no sooner began to drink of what they brought him, than he felt his
sickness leave him, and was as strong and well as in his younger days.
Then they went to their brother, and laughed at him, and said, ‘Well,
brother, you found the Water of Life, did you? You have had the trouble
and we shall have the reward. Pray, with all your cleverness, why did
not you manage to keep your eyes open? Next year one of us will take
away your beautiful princess, if you do not take care. You had better
say nothing about this to our father, for he does not believe a word you
say; and if you tell tales, you shall lose your life into the bargain:
but be quiet, and we will let you off.’

The old king was still very angry with his youngest son, and thought
that he really meant to have taken away his life; so he called his court
together, and asked what should be done, and all agreed that he ought to
be put to death. The prince knew nothing of what was going on, till one
day, when the king’s chief huntsmen went a-hunting with him, and they
were alone in the wood together, the huntsman looked so sorrowful that
the prince said, ‘My friend, what is the matter with you?’ ‘I cannot and
dare not tell you,’ said he. But the prince begged very hard, and said,
‘Only tell me what it is, and do not think I shall be angry, for I will
forgive you.’ ‘Alas!’ said the huntsman; ‘the king has ordered me to
shoot you.’ The prince started at this, and said, ‘Let me live, and I
will change dresses with you; you shall take my royal coat to show to my
father, and do you give me your shabby one.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said
the huntsman; ‘I am sure I shall be glad to save you, for I could not
have shot you.’ Then he took the prince’s coat, and gave him the shabby
one, and went away through the wood.

Some time after, three grand embassies came to the old king’s court,
with rich gifts of gold and precious stones for his youngest son; now
all these were sent from the three kings to whom he had lent his sword
and loaf of bread, in order to rid them of their enemy and feed their
people. This touched the old king’s heart, and he thought his son might
still be guiltless, and said to his court, ‘O that my son were still
alive! how it grieves me that I had him killed!’ ‘He is still alive,’
said the huntsman; ‘and I am glad that I had pity on him, but let him
go in peace, and brought home his royal coat.’ At this the king was
overwhelmed with joy, and made it known throughout all his kingdom, that
if his son would come back to his court he would forgive him.

Meanwhile the princess was eagerly waiting till her deliverer should
come back; and had a road made leading up to her palace all of shining
gold; and told her courtiers that whoever came on horseback, and rode
straight up to the gate upon it, was her true lover; and that they must
let him in: but whoever rode on one side of it, they must be sure was
not the right one; and that they must send him away at once.

The time soon came, when the eldest brother thought that he would make
haste to go to the princess, and say that he was the one who had set
her free, and that he should have her for his wife, and the kingdom with
her. As he came before the palace and saw the golden road, he stopped to
look at it, and he thought to himself, ‘It is a pity to ride upon this
beautiful road’; so he turned aside and rode on the right-hand side of
it. But when he came to the gate, the guards, who had seen the road
he took, said to him, he could not be what he said he was, and must go
about his business.

The second prince set out soon afterwards on the same errand; and when
he came to the golden road, and his horse had set one foot upon it,
he stopped to look at it, and thought it very beautiful, and said to
himself, ‘What a pity it is that anything should tread here!’ Then he
too turned aside and rode on the left side of it. But when he came to
the gate the guards said he was not the true prince, and that he too
must go away about his business; and away he went.

Now when the full year was come round, the third brother left the forest
in which he had lain hid for fear of his father’s anger, and set out in
search of his betrothed bride. So he journeyed on, thinking of her all
the way, and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the road was
made of, but went with his horse straight over it; and as he came to the
gate it flew open, and the princess welcomed him with joy, and said
he was her deliverer, and should now be her husband and lord of the
kingdom. When the first joy at their meeting was over, the princess told
him she had heard of his father having forgiven him, and of his wish to
have him home again: so, before his wedding with the princess, he went
to visit his father, taking her with him. Then he told him everything;
how his brothers had cheated and robbed him, and yet that he had borne
all those wrongs for the love of his father. And the old king was very
angry, and wanted to punish his wicked sons; but they made their escape,
and got into a ship and sailed away over the wide sea, and where they
went to nobody knew and nobody cared.

And now the old king gathered together his court, and asked all his
kingdom to come and celebrate the wedding of his son and the princess.
And young and old, noble and squire, gentle and simple, came at once
on the summons; and among the rest came the friendly dwarf, with the
sugarloaf hat, and a new scarlet cloak.

  And the wedding was held, and the merry bells run.
  And all the good people they danced and they sung,
  And feasted and frolick’d I can’t tell how long.


Now, tell a single original traditional German folktale based on the structure and style above. Do not generate multiple stories. Only one  story should be created, and it should follow the same narrative structure as the examples above. Conclude the story with 'The End.'

","Long ago, in a far-off land, there ruled a wise and just king who had three daughters. One day, the king fell gravely ill, and his daughters were filled with sorrow. They begged him to let them search for the legendary Elixir of Life, the only thing that could save him. The king, knowing the great danger they would face, refused at first. But the eldest daughter, filled with determination, pleaded so hard that the king finally relented.

She set out on her journey, following the same path as many others before her. As she crossed a treacherous mountain pass, she was confronted by a mischievous gnome who asked, ""Lady, where are you going so fast?"" The princess scoffed at the gnome and continued on her way. But the gnome, angered by her arrogance, placed a spell upon her, trapping her in the mountains.

Days turned into weeks, and the princess remained trapped, unable to move. She wept and prayed for deliverance, but her cries went unanswered.

Meanwhile, her sisters set out on their own journeys, seeking the Elixir of Life. Like their eldest sister, they too were confronted by the gnome, who asked the same question. But unlike their eldest sister, they were humble and kind, and the gnome revealed the location of the Elixir and offered them guidance.

The second princess followed the gnome's instructions, and she was able to free the eldest from her spell. But the gnome warned them that their sister's heart was as cold as ice, and that they must be wary of her.

The three sisters continued on their journey, and eventually they came upon a dark and foreboding castle. Inside, they found a beautiful princess, trapped in a magical sleep. The eldest sister, moved by the princess's plight, promised to return the following year and marry her, if only she would help them find the Elixir of Life.

The sisters searched the castle and found the Elixir, but as they made their way back to the entrance, the eldest sister fell asleep. The clock struck midnight, and the castle door slammed shut, trapping her inside forever.

The second sister, filled with grief, returned home with the Elixir, but her heart was heavy with guilt. She knew that her sister had been trapped because of her own pride, and she feared that their father would never forgive her.

When the eldest sister did not return, the second sister told their father everything that had happened. The king was filled with anger and sorrow, and he banished his daughter from the kingdom.

But the second sister could not bear to live without her sister, and she set out once more to find her. She searched high and low, but she could not find any trace of her.

Finally, she came upon a wise old man who told her that the eldest sister was trapped in a magical forest, and that she could only be freed by a knight who was brave and true.

The second sister, determined to save her sister, set out to find this knight. She traveled far and wide, and eventually she came upon a knight who was known for his bravery and honor.

She told him her story, and he agreed to help her. Together, they entered the magical forest, and they searched for the eldest sister for days.

Finally, they came upon a clearing, and there, trapped in a magical sleep, was the eldest sister. The knight, with the second sister by his side, fought the enchantment that held her captive, and they were able to free her.

The three sisters returned home, and they presented the Elixir of Life to their father. But the king, still filled with anger and sorrow, refused to forgive his eldest daughter.

The second sister, filled with guilt and regret, begged her father to forgive her sister, and to let them all live in peace. And the king, moved by his daughter's pleas, forgave his eldest daughter, and the three sisters lived happily ever after.

There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and
loved them with all the love of a mother for her children. One day she
wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called all
seven to her and said: ‘Dear children, I have to go into the forest,
be on your guard against the wolf; if he comes in, he will devour you
all--skin, hair, and everything. The wretch often disguises himself, but
you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.’ The
kids said: ‘Dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves; you may go
away without any anxiety.’ Then the old one bleated, and went on her way
with an easy mind.

It was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called:
‘Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought
something back with her for each of you.’ But the little kids knew that
it was the wolf, by the rough voice. ‘We will not open the door,’ cried
they, ‘you are not our mother. She has a soft, pleasant voice, but
your voice is rough; you are the wolf!’ Then the wolf went away to a
shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made
his voice soft with it. Then he came back, knocked at the door of the
house, and called: ‘Open the door, dear children, your mother is here
and has brought something back with her for each of you.’ But the wolf
had laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them
and cried: ‘We will not open the door, our mother has not black feet
like you: you are the wolf!’ Then the wolf ran to a baker and said: ‘I
have hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me.’ And when the baker
had rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said: ‘Strew some
white meal over my feet for me.’ The miller thought to himself: ‘The
wolf wants to deceive someone,’ and refused; but the wolf said: ‘If you
will not do it, I will devour you.’ Then the miller was afraid, and made
his paws white for him. Truly, this is the way of mankind.

So now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at
it and said: ‘Open the door for me, children, your dear little mother
has come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the
forest with her.’ The little kids cried: ‘First show us your paws that
we may know if you are our dear little mother.’ Then he put his paws
in through the window and when the kids saw that they were white, they
believed that all he said was true, and opened the door. But who should
come in but the wolf! They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves.
One sprang under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the
stove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the
sixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case. But
the wolf found them all, and used no great ceremony; one after the
other he swallowed them down his throat. The youngest, who was in
the clock-case, was the only one he did not find. When the wolf had
satisfied his appetite he took himself off, laid himself down under a
tree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep. Soon afterwards
the old goat came home again from the forest. Ah! what a sight she saw
there! The house-door stood wide open. The table, chairs, and benches
were thrown down, the washing-bowl lay broken to pieces, and the quilts
and pillows were pulled off the bed. She sought her children, but they
were nowhere to be found. She called them one after another by name, but
no one answered. At last, when she came to the youngest, a soft voice
cried: ‘Dear mother, I am in the clock-case.’ She took the kid out, and
it told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others. Then
you may imagine how she wept over her poor children.

At length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with her.
When they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree and snored
so loud that the branches shook. She looked at him on every side and
saw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly. ‘Ah,
heavens,’ she said, ‘is it possible that my poor children whom he has
swallowed down for his supper, can be still alive?’ Then the kid had to
run home and fetch scissors, and a needle and thread, and the goat cut
open the monster’s stomach, and hardly had she made one cut, than one
little kid thrust its head out, and when she had cut farther, all six
sprang out one after another, and were all still alive, and had suffered
no injury whatever, for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them
down whole. What rejoicing there was! They embraced their dear mother,
and jumped like a tailor at his wedding. The mother, however, said: ‘Now
go and look for some big stones, and we will fill the wicked beast’s
stomach with them while he is still asleep.’ Then the seven kids dragged
the stones thither with all speed, and put as many of them into this
stomach as they could get in; and the mother sewed him up again in the
greatest haste, so that he was not aware of anything and never once
stirred.

When the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his legs,
and as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to
go to a well to drink. But when he began to walk and to move about, the
stones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled. Then cried
he:

 ‘What rumbles and tumbles
  Against my poor bones?
  I thought ‘twas six kids,
  But it feels like big stones.’

And when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink, the
heavy stones made him fall in, and he drowned miserably. When the seven
kids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud: ‘The wolf
is dead! The wolf is dead!’ and danced for joy round about the well with
their mother.
A great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was very
beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of the
princes who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her, and she
only made sport of them.

Once upon a time the king held a great feast, and asked thither all
her suitors; and they all sat in a row, ranged according to their
rank--kings, and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons,
and knights. Then the princess came in, and as she passed by them she
had something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat: ‘He’s
as round as a tub,’ said she. The next was too tall: ‘What a maypole!’
said she. The next was too short: ‘What a dumpling!’ said she. The
fourth was too pale, and she called him ‘Wallface.’ The fifth was too
red, so she called him ‘Coxcomb.’ The sixth was not straight enough;
so she said he was like a green stick, that had been laid to dry over
a baker’s oven. And thus she had some joke to crack upon every one: but
she laughed more than all at a good king who was there. ‘Look at
him,’ said she; ‘his beard is like an old mop; he shall be called
Grisly-beard.’ So the king got the nickname of Grisly-beard.

But the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved,
and how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or
unwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that
came to the door.

Two days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play
under the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said,
‘Let him come in.’ So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when
he had sung before the king and the princess, he begged a boon. Then the
king said, ‘You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for
your wife.’ The princess begged and prayed; but the king said, ‘I have
sworn to give you to the first comer, and I will keep my word.’ So words
and tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married
to the fiddler. When this was over the king said, ‘Now get ready to
go--you must not stay here--you must travel on with your husband.’

Then the fiddler went his way, and took her with him, and they soon came
to a great wood. ‘Pray,’ said she, ‘whose is this wood?’ ‘It belongs
to King Grisly-beard,’ answered he; ‘hadst thou taken him, all had been
thine.’ ‘Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘would that I had
married King Grisly-beard!’ Next they came to some fine meadows. ‘Whose
are these beautiful green meadows?’ said she. ‘They belong to King
Grisly-beard, hadst thou taken him, they had all been thine.’ ‘Ah!
unlucky wretch that I am!’ said she; ‘would that I had married King
Grisly-beard!’

Then they came to a great city. ‘Whose is this noble city?’ said she.
‘It belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all been
thine.’ ‘Ah! wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘why did I not marry King
Grisly-beard?’ ‘That is no business of mine,’ said the fiddler: ‘why
should you wish for another husband? Am not I good enough for you?’

At last they came to a small cottage. ‘What a paltry place!’ said she;
‘to whom does that little dirty hole belong?’ Then the fiddler said,
‘That is your and my house, where we are to live.’ ‘Where are your
servants?’ cried she. ‘What do we want with servants?’ said he; ‘you
must do for yourself whatever is to be done. Now make the fire, and put
on water and cook my supper, for I am very tired.’ But the princess knew
nothing of making fires and cooking, and the fiddler was forced to help
her. When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the
fiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house. Thus
they lived for two days: and when they had eaten up all there was in the
cottage, the man said, ‘Wife, we can’t go on thus, spending money and
earning nothing. You must learn to weave baskets.’ Then he went out and
cut willows, and brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made
her fingers very sore. ‘I see this work won’t do,’ said he: ‘try and
spin; perhaps you will do that better.’ So she sat down and tried to
spin; but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran. ‘See
now,’ said the fiddler, ‘you are good for nothing; you can do no work:
what a bargain I have got! However, I’ll try and set up a trade in pots
and pans, and you shall stand in the market and sell them.’ ‘Alas!’
sighed she, ‘if any of my father’s court should pass by and see me
standing in the market, how they will laugh at me!’

But her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if she
did not wish to die of hunger. At first the trade went well; for many
people, seeing such a beautiful woman, went to buy her wares, and paid
their money without thinking of taking away the goods. They lived on
this as long as it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of
ware, and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market; but
a drunken soldier soon came by, and rode his horse against her stall,
and broke all her goods into a thousand pieces. Then she began to cry,
and knew not what to do. ‘Ah! what will become of me?’ said she; ‘what
will my husband say?’ So she ran home and told him all. ‘Who would
have thought you would have been so silly,’ said he, ‘as to put an
earthenware stall in the corner of the market, where everybody passes?
but let us have no more crying; I see you are not fit for this sort of
work, so I have been to the king’s palace, and asked if they did not
want a kitchen-maid; and they say they will take you, and there you will
have plenty to eat.’

Thus the princess became a kitchen-maid, and helped the cook to do all
the dirtiest work; but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat
that was left, and on this they lived.

She had not been there long before she heard that the king’s eldest son
was passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the windows
and looked out. Everything was ready, and all the pomp and brightness of
the court was there. Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly
which had brought her so low. And the servants gave her some of the rich
meats, which she put into her basket to take home.

All on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king’s son in golden
clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her
by the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she
trembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was
making sport of her. However, he kept fast hold, and led her in; and the
cover of the basket came off, so that the meats in it fell about. Then
everybody laughed and jeered at her; and she was so abashed, that she
wished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth. She sprang to the
door to run away; but on the steps King Grisly-beard overtook her, and
brought her back and said, ‘Fear me not! I am the fiddler who has lived
with you in the hut. I brought you there because I really loved you. I
am also the soldier that overset your stall. I have done all this only
to cure you of your silly pride, and to show you the folly of your
ill-treatment of me. Now all is over: you have learnt wisdom, and it is
time to hold our marriage feast.’

Then the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes; and
her father and his whole court were there already, and welcomed her home
on her marriage. Joy was in every face and every heart. The feast was
grand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish that you
and I had been of the party.

There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so
the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he

","Once upon a time, there was a wise old owl who lived in a hollow tree in the heart of the forest. He had three little owlets, and he loved them with all the love of a father for his children. One day he wanted to go into the forest and hunt for food. So he called all three to him and said: ‘Dear children, I have to go into the forest, be on your guard against the fox; if he comes in, he will devour you all--feathers, beak, and everything. The cunning creature often disguises himself, but you will know him at once by his rough voice and his red feet.’ The owlets said: ‘Dear father, we will take good care of ourselves; you may go away without any anxiety.’ Then the old one hooted, and went on his way with an easy mind.

It was not long before someone knocked at the tree-hole and called: ‘Open the door, dear children; your father is here, and has brought something back with him for each of you.’ But the little owlets knew that it was the fox, by the rough voice. ‘We will not open the door,’ cried they, ‘you are not our father. He has a soft, pleasant voice, but your voice is rough; you are the fox!’ Then the fox went away to a farmer and asked him for a sack of flour, saying that he had hurt his voice and wanted to make it soft with it. The farmer, not knowing that it was the fox, gave him the sack. The fox then came back, knocked at the tree-hole, and called: ‘Open the door, dear children, your father is here, and has brought something back with him for each of you.’ But the owlets had laid their white feathers against the window, and the fox saw them and cried: ‘We will not open the door, our father has not white feathers like you: you are the fox!’ Then the fox ran to a baker and said: ‘I have hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me.’ And when the baker had rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said: ‘Strew some white meal over my feet for me.’ The miller thought to himself: ‘The fox wants to deceive someone,’ and refused; but the fox said: ‘If you will not do it, I will devour you.’ Then the miller was afraid, and made his paws white for him. Truly, this is the way of mankind.

So now the fox went for the third time to the tree-hole, knocked at it, and called: ‘Open the door for me, children, your dear little father has come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the forest with him.’ The little owlets cried: ‘First show us your paws that we may know if you are our dear little father.’ Then he put his paws in through the window and when the owlets saw that they were white, they believed that all he said was true, and opened the door. But who should come in but the fox! They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves. One sprang under the bed, the second into the nest, the third into the cupboard. But the fox found them all, and used no great ceremony; one after the other he swallowed them down his throat. The youngest, who was in the cupboard, was the only one he did not find. When the fox had satiated his appetite he took himself off, and the youngest owlet was left alone.

At length in his grief the old owl came home from the forest. Ah! what a sight he saw there! The tree-hole stood wide open. The bed, the nest, and the cupboard were thrown down, and the feathers were pulled off the bed. He sought his children, but they were nowhere to be found. He called them one after another by name, but no one answered. At last, when he came to the youngest, a soft voice cried: ‘Dear father, I am in the cupboard.’ He took the owlet out, and it told him that the fox had come and had eaten all the others. Then you may imagine how he wept over his poor children.

At length in his grief he went out, and the youngest owlet ran with him. When they came to the meadow, there lay the fox by the tree and snored so loud that the branches shook. He looked at him on every side and saw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly. ‘Ah, heavens,’ he said, ‘is it possible that my poor children whom he has swallowed down for his supper, can be still alive?’ Then the owlet had to run home and fetch scissors, and a needle and thread, and the owl cut open the monster’s stomach, and hardly had he made one cut, than one little owlet thrust its head out, and when he had cut farther, all three sprang out one after another, and were all still alive, and had suffered no injury whatever, for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them down whole. What rejoicing there was! They embraced their dear father, and jumped like a tailor at his wedding. The father, however, said: ‘Now go and look for some big stones, and we will fill the wicked beast’s stomach with them while he is still asleep.’ Then the three owlets dragged the stones thither with all speed, and put as many of them into this stomach as they could get in; and the father sewed him up again in the greatest haste, so that he was not aware of anything and never once stirred.

When the fox at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his legs, and as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to go to a well to drink. But when he began to walk and to move about, the stones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled. Then cried he:

 ‘What rumbles and tumbles
  Against my poor bones?
  I thought ‘twas three kids,
  But it feels like big stones.’

And when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink, the
heavy stones made him fall in, and he drowned miserably. When the three
owlets saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud: ‘The fox
is dead! The fox is dead!’ and danced for joy round about the well with
their father.

A shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old,
and had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wife
were standing together before the house the shepherd said, ‘I will shoot
old Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.’ But his wife
said, ‘Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a
great many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of
his days.’ ‘But what can we do with him?’ said the shepherd, ‘he has not
a tooth in his head, and the thieves don’t care for him at all; to
be sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood;
tomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.’

Poor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd
and his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think
tomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good
friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows,
and how his master meant to kill him in the morning. ‘Make yourself
easy,’ said the wolf, ‘I will give you some good advice. Your master,
you know, goes out every morning very early with his wife into the
field; and they take their little child with them, and lay it down
behind the hedge in the shade while they are at work. Now do you lie
down close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come
out of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as
you can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they
will think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you
that they will take care of you as long as you live.’ The dog liked this
plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed. The wolf ran with the
child a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan
soon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master
and mistress. Then the shepherd patted him on the head, and said, ‘Old
Sultan has saved our child from the wolf, and therefore he shall live
and be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat. Wife, go home, and
give him a good dinner, and let him have my old cushion to sleep on
as long as he lives.’ So from this time forward Sultan had all that he
could wish for.

Soon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, ‘Now, my
good fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way
when I want to taste one of the old shepherd’s fine fat sheep.’ ‘No,’
said the Sultan; ‘I will be true to my master.’ However, the wolf
thought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel. But
Sultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait
for him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for
a good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed
his locks for him finely.

Then the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan ‘an old rogue,’ and
swore he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf sent the
boar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter. Now
Sultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd’s old
three-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped
along with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air.

The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they
espied their enemies coming, and saw the cat’s long tail standing
straight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to
fight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up
a stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of
fighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped
up into a tree. Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked about and
wondered that no one was there. The boar, however, had not quite hidden
himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of
them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a
mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped
up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, ‘Look up in the tree, there
sits the one who is to blame.’ So they looked up, and espied the wolf
sitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal,
and would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of
himself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.
There was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called
Dummling,[*] and was despised, mocked, and sneered at on every occasion.

It happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood,
and before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a
bottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.

When he entered the forest he met a little grey-haired old man who bade
him good day, and said: ‘Do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket,
and let me have a draught of your wine; I am so hungry and thirsty.’ But
the clever son answered: ‘If I give you my cake and wine, I shall have
none for myself; be off with you,’ and he left the little man standing
and went on.

But when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a
false stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go home
and have it bound up. And this was the little grey man’s doing.

After this the second son went into the forest, and his mother gave him,
like the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine. The little old grey man
met him likewise, and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine.
But the second son, too, said sensibly enough: ‘What I give you will be
taken away from myself; be off!’ and he left the little man standing and
went on. His punishment, however, was not delayed; when he had made a
few blows at the tree he struck himself in the leg, so that he had to be
carried home.

Then Dummling said: ‘Father, do let me go and cut wood.’ The father
answered: ‘Your brothers have hurt themselves with it, leave it alone,
you do not understand anything about it.’ But Dummling begged so long
that at last he said: ‘Just go then, you will get wiser by hurting
yourself.’ His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the
cinders, and with it a bottle of sour beer.

When he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise,
and greeting him, said: ‘Give me a piece of your cake and a drink out
of your bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty.’ Dummling answered: ‘I have
only cinder-cake and sour beer; if that pleases you, we will sit
down and eat.’ So they sat down, and when Dummling pulled out his
cinder-cake, it was a fine sweet cake, and the sour beer had become good
wine. So they ate and drank, and after that the little man said: ‘Since
you have a good heart, and are willing to divide what you have, I will
give you good luck. There stands an old tree, cut it down, and you will
find something at the roots.’ Then the little man took leave of him.

Dummling went and cut down the tree, and when it fell there was a goose
sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. He lifted her up, and
taking her with him, went to an inn where he thought he would stay the
night. Now the host had three daughters, who saw the goose and were
curious to know what such a wonderful bird might be, and would have
liked to have one of its golden feathers.

The eldest thought: ‘I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a
feather,’ and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by
the wing, but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.

The second came soon afterwards, thinking only of how she might get a
feather for herself, but she had scarcely touched her sister than she
was held fast.

At last the third also came with the like intent, and the others
screamed out: ‘Keep away; for goodness’ sake keep away!’ But she did
not understand why she was to keep away. ‘The others are there,’ she
thought, ‘I may as well be there too,’ and ran to them; but as soon as
she had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to her. So they
had to spend the night with the goose.

The next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set out,
without troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to
it. They were obliged to run after him continually, now left, now right,
wherever his legs took him.

In the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw the
procession he said: ‘For shame, you good-for-nothing girls, why are you
running across the fields after this young man? Is that seemly?’ At the
same time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away,
but as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast, and was himself
obliged to run behind.

Before long the sexton came by and saw his master, the parson, running
behind three girls. He was astonished at this and called out: ‘Hi!
your reverence, whither away so quickly? Do not forget that we have a
christening today!’ and running after him he took him by the sleeve, but
was also held fast to it.

Whilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other, two labourers
came with their hoes from the fields; the parson called out to them
and begged that they would set him and the sexton free. But they had
scarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast, and now there were
seven of them running behind Dummling and the goose.

Soon afterwards he came to a city, where a king ruled who had a daughter
who was so serious that no one could make her laugh. So he had put forth
a decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marry
her. When Dummling heard this, he went with his goose and all her train
before the king’s daughter, and as soon as she saw the seven people
running on and on, one behind the other, she began to laugh quite
loudly, and as if she would never stop. Thereupon Dummling asked to have
her for his wife; but the king did not like the son-in-law, and made all
manner of excuses and said he must first produce a man who could drink
a cellarful of wine. Dummling thought of the little grey man, who could
certainly help him; so he went into the forest, and in the same place
where he had felled the tree, he saw a man sitting, who had a very
sorrowful face. Dummling asked him what he was taking to heart so
sorely, and he answered: ‘I have such a great thirst and cannot quench
it; cold water I cannot stand, a barrel of wine I have just emptied, but
that to me is like a drop on a hot stone!’

‘There, I can help you,’ said Dummling, ‘just come with me and you shall
be satisfied.’

He led him into the king’s cellar, and the man bent over the huge
barrels, and drank and drank till his loins hurt, and before the day was
out he had emptied all the barrels. Then Dummling asked once more
for his bride, but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow, whom
everyone called Dummling, should take away his daughter, and he made a
new condition; he must first find a man who could eat a whole mountain
of bread. Dummling did not think long, but went straight into the
forest, where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his
body with a strap, and making an awful face, and saying: ‘I have eaten a
whole ovenful of rolls, but what good is that when one has such a hunger
as I? My stomach remains empty, and I must tie myself up if I am not to
die of hunger.’

At this Dummling was glad, and said: ‘Get up and come with me; you shall
eat yourself full.’ He led him to the king’s palace where all the
flour in the whole Kingdom was collected, and from it he caused a huge
mountain of bread to be baked. The man from the forest stood before it,
began to eat, and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished.
Then Dummling for the third time asked for his bride; but the king again
sought a way out, and ordered a ship which could sail on land and on
water. ‘As soon as you come sailing back in it,’ said he, ‘you shall
have my daughter for wife.’

Dummling went straight into the forest, and there sat the little grey
man to whom he had given his cake. When he heard what Dummling wanted,
he said: ‘Since you have given me to eat and to drink, I will give you
the ship; and I do all this because you once were kind to me.’ Then he
gave him the ship which could sail on land and water, and when the king
saw that, he could no longer prevent him from having his daughter. The
wedding was celebrated, and after the king’s death, Dummling inherited
his kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife.

There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so
the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he
did spill a little of anything.

","A cobbler had a loyal dog, named Max, who had grown old and lost all his teeth. And one day when the cobbler and his wife were sitting together in their small cottage, the cobbler said, ‘I will shoot old Max tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.’ But his wife said, ‘Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a great many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of his days.’ ‘But what can we do with him?’ said the cobbler, ‘he has not a tooth in his head, and the rats don’t care for him at all; to be sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood; tomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.’

Poor Max, who was lying close by them, heard all that the cobbler and his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think tomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good friend the fox, who lived in the forest, and told him all his sorrows, and how his master meant to kill him in the morning. ‘Make yourself easy,’ said the fox, ‘I will give you some good advice. Your master, you know, goes out every morning very early to the market to sell his shoes; and he takes his little child with him, and lays it down behind the stall while he is busy. Now do you lie down close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come out of the forest and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as you can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they will think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you that they will take care of you as long as you live.’ The dog liked this plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed.

There was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name was
Catherine, and they had not long been married. One day Frederick said.
‘Kate! I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be
hungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale.’
‘Very well,’ said she, ‘it shall all be ready.’ When dinner-time drew
nigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and
put it on the fire to fry. The steak soon began to look brown, and to
crackle in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it:
then she said to herself, ‘The steak is almost ready, I may as well go
to the cellar for the ale.’ So she left the pan on the fire and took a
large jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. The beer ran
into the jug and Catherine stood looking on. At last it popped into her
head, ‘The dog is not shut up--he may be running away with the steak;
that’s well thought of.’ So up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough
the rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth, and was making off with
it.

Away ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran
faster than she, and stuck close to the steak. ‘It’s all gone, and “what
can’t be cured must be endured”,’ said Catherine. So she turned round;
and as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely
to cool herself.

Now all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not turned
the cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till
the cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had
happened. ‘My stars!’ said she, ‘what shall I do to keep Frederick from
seeing all this slopping about?’ So she thought a while; and at last
remembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair,
and that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale
nicely. ‘What a lucky thing,’ said she, ‘that we kept that meal! we have
now a good use for it.’ So away she went for it: but she managed to set
it down just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus
all the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. ‘Ah!
well,’ said she, ‘when one goes another may as well follow.’ Then she
strewed the meal all about the cellar, and was quite pleased with her
cleverness, and said, ‘How very neat and clean it looks!’

At noon Frederick came home. ‘Now, wife,’ cried he, ‘what have you for
dinner?’ ‘O Frederick!’ answered she, ‘I was cooking you a steak; but
while I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while
I ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale
with the sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but the
cellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!’ ‘Kate, Kate,’ said he,
‘how could you do all this?’ Why did you leave the steak to fry, and the
ale to run, and then spoil all the meal?’ ‘Why, Frederick,’ said she, ‘I
did not know I was doing wrong; you should have told me before.’

The husband thought to himself, ‘If my wife manages matters thus, I must
look sharp myself.’ Now he had a good deal of gold in the house: so he
said to Catherine, ‘What pretty yellow buttons these are! I shall put
them into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you
never go near or meddle with them.’ ‘No, Frederick,’ said she, ‘that
I never will.’ As soon as he was gone, there came by some pedlars with
earthenware plates and dishes, and they asked her whether she would buy.
‘Oh dear me, I should like to buy very much, but I have no money: if
you had any use for yellow buttons, I might deal with you.’ ‘Yellow
buttons!’ said they: ‘let us have a look at them.’ ‘Go into the garden
and dig where I tell you, and you will find the yellow buttons: I dare
not go myself.’ So the rogues went: and when they found what these
yellow buttons were, they took them all away, and left her plenty of
plates and dishes. Then she set them all about the house for a show:
and when Frederick came back, he cried out, ‘Kate, what have you been
doing?’ ‘See,’ said she, ‘I have bought all these with your yellow
buttons: but I did not touch them myself; the pedlars went themselves
and dug them up.’ ‘Wife, wife,’ said Frederick, ‘what a pretty piece of
work you have made! those yellow buttons were all my money: how came you
to do such a thing?’ ‘Why,’ answered she, ‘I did not know there was any
harm in it; you should have told me.’

Catherine stood musing for a while, and at last said to her husband,
‘Hark ye, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back: let us run after
the thieves.’ ‘Well, we will try,’ answered he; ‘but take some butter
and cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.’
‘Very well,’ said she; and they set out: and as Frederick walked the
fastest, he left his wife some way behind. ‘It does not matter,’ thought
she: ‘when we turn back, I shall be so much nearer home than he.’

Presently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there
was a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees
on each side as they passed. ‘Ah, see now,’ said she, ‘how they have
bruised and wounded those poor trees; they will never get well.’ So she
took pity on them, and made use of the butter to grease them all, so
that the wheels might not hurt them so much. While she was doing this
kind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket, and rolled down
the hill. Catherine looked, but could not see where it had gone; so she
said, ‘Well, I suppose the other will go the same way and find you; he
has younger legs than I have.’ Then she rolled the other cheese after
it; and away it went, nobody knows where, down the hill. But she said
she supposed that they knew the road, and would follow her, and she
could not stay there all day waiting for them.

At last she overtook Frederick, who desired her to give him something to
eat. Then she gave him the dry bread. ‘Where are the butter and cheese?’
said he. ‘Oh!’ answered she, ‘I used the butter to grease those poor
trees that the wheels chafed so: and one of the cheeses ran away so I
sent the other after it to find it, and I suppose they are both on
the road together somewhere.’ ‘What a goose you are to do such silly
things!’ said the husband. ‘How can you say so?’ said she; ‘I am sure
you never told me not.’

They ate the dry bread together; and Frederick said, ‘Kate, I hope you
locked the door safe when you came away.’ ‘No,’ answered she, ‘you did
not tell me.’ ‘Then go home, and do it now before we go any farther,’
said Frederick, ‘and bring with you something to eat.’

Catherine did as he told her, and thought to herself by the way,
‘Frederick wants something to eat; but I don’t think he is very fond of
butter and cheese: I’ll bring him a bag of fine nuts, and the vinegar,
for I have often seen him take some.’

When she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front door she
took off the hinges, and said, ‘Frederick told me to lock the door, but
surely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me.’ So she took
her time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she cried
out, ‘There, Frederick, there is the door itself, you may watch it as
carefully as you please.’ ‘Alas! alas!’ said he, ‘what a clever wife I
have! I sent you to make the house fast, and you take the door away, so
that everybody may go in and out as they please--however, as you have
brought the door, you shall carry it about with you for your pains.’
‘Very well,’ answered she, ‘I’ll carry the door; but I’ll not carry the
nuts and vinegar bottle also--that would be too much of a load; so if
you please, I’ll fasten them to the door.’

Frederick of course made no objection to that plan, and they set off
into the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find them: and
when it grew dark, they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there.
Scarcely were they up, than who should come by but the very rogues they
were looking for. They were in truth great rascals, and belonged to that
class of people who find things before they are lost; they were tired;
so they sat down and made a fire under the very tree where Frederick and
Catherine were. Frederick slipped down on the other side, and picked up
some stones. Then he climbed up again, and tried to hit the thieves on
the head with them: but they only said, ‘It must be near morning, for
the wind shakes the fir-apples down.’

Catherine, who had the door on her shoulder, began to be very tired;
but she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy: so she said
softly, ‘Frederick, I must let the nuts go.’ ‘No,’ answered he, ‘not
now, they will discover us.’ ‘I can’t help that: they must go.’ ‘Well,
then, make haste and throw them down, if you will.’ Then away rattled
the nuts down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried, ‘Bless me,
it is hailing.’

A little while after, Catherine thought the door was still very heavy:
so she whispered to Frederick, ‘I must throw the vinegar down.’ ‘Pray
don’t,’ answered he, ‘it will discover us.’ ‘I can’t help that,’ said
she, ‘go it must.’ So she poured all the vinegar down; and the thieves
said, ‘What a heavy dew there is!’

At last it popped into Catherine’s head that it was the door itself that
was so heavy all the time: so she whispered, ‘Frederick, I must throw
the door down soon.’ But he begged and prayed her not to do so, for he
was sure it would betray them. ‘Here goes, however,’ said she: and down
went the door with such a clatter upon the thieves, that they cried
out ‘Murder!’ and not knowing what was coming, ran away as fast as they
could, and left all the gold. So when Frederick and Catherine came down,
there they found all their money safe and sound.
A shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old,
and had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wife
were standing together before the house the shepherd said, ‘I will shoot
old Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.’ But his wife
said, ‘Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a
great many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of
his days.’ ‘But what can we do with him?’ said the shepherd, ‘he has not
a tooth in his head, and the thieves don’t care for him at all; to
be sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood;
tomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.’

Poor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd
and his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think
tomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good
friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows,
and how his master meant to kill him in the morning. ‘Make yourself
easy,’ said the wolf, ‘I will give you some good advice. Your master,
you know, goes out every morning very early with his wife into the
field; and they take their little child with them, and lay it down
behind the hedge in the shade while they are at work. Now do you lie
down close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come
out of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as
you can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they
will think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you
that they will take care of you as long as you live.’ The dog liked this
plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed. The wolf ran with the
child a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan
soon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master
and mistress. Then the shepherd patted him on the head, and said, ‘Old
Sultan has saved our child from the wolf, and therefore he shall live
and be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat. Wife, go home, and
give him a good dinner, and let him have my old cushion to sleep on
as long as he lives.’ So from this time forward Sultan had all that he
could wish for.

Soon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, ‘Now, my
good fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way
when I want to taste one of the old shepherd’s fine fat sheep.’ ‘No,’
said the Sultan; ‘I will be true to my master.’ However, the wolf
thought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel. But
Sultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait
for him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for
a good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed
his locks for him finely.

Then the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan ‘an old rogue,’ and
swore he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf sent the
boar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter. Now
Sultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd’s old
three-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped
along with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air.

The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they
espied their enemies coming, and saw the cat’s long tail standing
straight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to
fight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up
a stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of
fighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped
up into a tree. Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked about and
wondered that no one was there. The boar, however, had not quite hidden
himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of
them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a
mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped
up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, ‘Look up in the tree, there
sits the one who is to blame.’ So they looked up, and espied the wolf
sitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal,
and would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of
himself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.

Now, tell a single original traditional German folktale based on the structure and style above. Do not generate multiple stories. Only one  story should be created, and it should follow the same narrative structure as the examples above. Conclude the story with 'The End.'

","There was once a man called Hans: he had a wife whose name was
Maria, and they had not long been married. One day Hans said, ‘Maria! I
am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be hungry so
let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale.’ ‘Very
well,’ said she, ‘it shall all be ready.’ When dinner-time drew
nigh, Maria took a nice piece of venison, which was all the meat she had,
and put it on the fire to roast. The venison soon began to sizzle and
smell delicious; and Maria stood by with a fork and turned it: then she
said to herself, ‘The venison is almost ready, I may as well go
to the cellar for the ale.’ So she left the venison on the fire and took
a large jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. The beer
ran into the jug and Maria stood looking on. At last it popped into her
head, ‘The cat is not shut up--it may be playing with the venison; that’s
well thought of.’ So up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough the
rascally feline had got the venison in its mouth, and was making off with
it.

Away ran Maria, and away ran the cat across the field: but it ran
faster than she, and stuck close to the venison. ‘It’s all gone, and “what
can’t be cured must be endured”,’ said Maria. So she turned round; and
as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely to
cool herself.

Now all this time the ale was running too, for Maria had not turned
the cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till
the cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had
happened. ‘My stars!’ said she, ‘what shall I do to keep Hans from
seeing all this slopping about?’ So she thought a while; and at last
remembered that there was a sack of fine flour bought at the last fair,
and that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale
nicely. ‘What a lucky thing,’ said she, ‘that we kept that flour! we
have now a good use for it.’ So away she went for it: but she managed to
set it down just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus
all the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. ‘Ah!
well,’ said she, ‘when one goes another may as well follow.’ Then she
strewed the flour all about the cellar, and was quite pleased with her
cleverness, and said, ‘How very neat and clean it looks!’

At noon Hans came home. ‘Now, wife,’ cried he, ‘what have you for
dinner?’ ‘O Hans!’ answered she, ‘I was cooking you a piece of venison;
but while I went down to draw the ale, the cat ran away with it; and
while I ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the
ale with the sack of flour that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but
the cellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!’ ‘Hans, Hans,’ said he,
‘how could you do all this?’ Why did you leave the venison to roast, and
the ale to run, and then spoil all the flour?’ ‘Why, Hans,’ said she, ‘I
did not know I was doing wrong; you should have told me before.’

Hans thought to himself, ‘If my wife manages matters thus, I must
look sharp myself.’ Now he had a good deal of gold in the house: so he
said to Maria, ‘What pretty silver buttons these are! I shall put
them into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you
never go near or meddle with them.’ ‘No, Hans,’ said she, ‘that
I never will.’ As soon as he was gone, there came by some pedlars with
earthenware plates and dishes, and they asked her whether she would buy.
‘Oh dear me, I should like to buy very much, but I have no money: if
you had any use for silver buttons, I might deal with you.’ ‘Silver
buttons!’ said they: ‘let us have a look at them.’ ‘Go into the garden
and dig where I tell you, and you will find the silver buttons: I dare
not go myself.’ So the rogues went: and when they found what these
silver buttons were, they took them all away, and left her plenty of
plates and dishes. Then she set them all about the house for a show:
and when Hans came back, he cried out, ‘Maria, what have you been
doing?’ ‘See,’ said she, ‘I have bought all these with your silver
buttons: but I did not touch them myself; the pedlars went themselves
and dug them up.’ ‘Hans, Hans,’ said Frederick, ‘what a pretty piece of
work you have made! those silver buttons were all my money: how came you
to do such a thing?’ ‘Why,’ answered she, ‘I did not know there was any
harm in it; you should have told me.’

Maria stood musing for a while, and at last said to her husband,
‘Hark ye, Hans, we will soon get the gold back: let us run after
the thieves.’ ‘Well, we will try,’ answered he; ‘but take some bread
and cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.’
‘Very well,’ said she; and they set out: and as Hans walked the
fastest, he left his wife some way behind. ‘It does not matter,’ thought
she: ‘when we turn back, I shall be so much nearer home than he.’

Presently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there
was a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees
on each side as they passed. ‘Ah, see now,’ said she, ‘how they have
bruised and wounded those poor trees; they will never get well.’ So she
took pity on them, and made use of the bread to grease them all, so
that the wheels might not hurt them so much. While she was doing this
kind office one of the cheeses fell out of the basket, and rolled down
the hill. Maria looked, but could not see where it had gone; so she
said, ‘Well, I suppose the other will go the same way and find you; he
has younger legs than I have.’ Then she rolled the other cheese after
it; and away it went, nobody knows where, down the hill. But she said
she supposed that they knew the road, and would follow her, and she
could not stay there all day waiting for them.

At last she overtook Hans, who desired her to give him something to
eat. Then she gave him the dry bread. ‘Where are the bread and cheese?’
said he. ‘Oh!’ answered she, ‘I used the bread to grease those poor
trees that the wheels chafed so: and one of the cheeses ran away so I
sent the other after it to find it, and I suppose they are both on
the road together somewhere.’ ‘What a goose you are to do such silly
things!’ said the husband. ‘How can you say so?’ said she; ‘I am sure
you never told me not.’

They ate the dry bread together; and Hans said, ‘Maria, I hope you
locked the door safe when you came away.’ ‘No,’ answered she, ‘you did
not tell me.’"

A great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was very
beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of the
princes who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her, and she
only made sport of them.

Once upon a time the king held a great feast, and asked thither all
her suitors; and they all sat in a row, ranged according to their
rank--kings, and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons,
and knights. Then the princess came in, and as she passed by them she
had something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat: ‘He’s
as round as a tub,’ said she. The next was too tall: ‘What a maypole!’
said she. The next was too short: ‘What a dumpling!’ said she. The
fourth was too pale, and she called him ‘Wallface.’ The fifth was too
red, so she called him ‘Coxcomb.’ The sixth was not straight enough;
so she said he was like a green stick, that had been laid to dry over
a baker’s oven. And thus she had some joke to crack upon every one: but
she laughed more than all at a good king who was there. ‘Look at
him,’ said she; ‘his beard is like an old mop; he shall be called
Grisly-beard.’ So the king got the nickname of Grisly-beard.

But the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved,
and how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or
unwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that
came to the door.

Two days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play
under the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said,
‘Let him come in.’ So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when
he had sung before the king and the princess, he begged a boon. Then the
king said, ‘You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for
your wife.’ The princess begged and prayed; but the king said, ‘I have
sworn to give you to the first comer, and I will keep my word.’ So words
and tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married
to the fiddler. When this was over the king said, ‘Now get ready to
go--you must not stay here--you must travel on with your husband.’

Then the fiddler went his way, and took her with him, and they soon came
to a great wood. ‘Pray,’ said she, ‘whose is this wood?’ ‘It belongs
to King Grisly-beard,’ answered he; ‘hadst thou taken him, all had been
thine.’ ‘Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘would that I had
married King Grisly-beard!’ Next they came to some fine meadows. ‘Whose
are these beautiful green meadows?’ said she. ‘They belong to King
Grisly-beard, hadst thou taken him, they had all been thine.’ ‘Ah!
unlucky wretch that I am!’ said she; ‘would that I had married King
Grisly-beard!’

Then they came to a great city. ‘Whose is this noble city?’ said she.
‘It belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all been
thine.’ ‘Ah! wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘why did I not marry King
Grisly-beard?’ ‘That is no business of mine,’ said the fiddler: ‘why
should you wish for another husband? Am not I good enough for you?’

At last they came to a small cottage. ‘What a paltry place!’ said she;
‘to whom does that little dirty hole belong?’ Then the fiddler said,
‘That is your and my house, where we are to live.’ ‘Where are your
servants?’ cried she. ‘What do we want with servants?’ said he; ‘you
must do for yourself whatever is to be done. Now make the fire, and put
on water and cook my supper, for I am very tired.’ But the princess knew
nothing of making fires and cooking, and the fiddler was forced to help
her. When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the
fiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house. Thus
they lived for two days: and when they had eaten up all there was in the
cottage, the man said, ‘Wife, we can’t go on thus, spending money and
earning nothing. You must learn to weave baskets.’ Then he went out and
cut willows, and brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made
her fingers very sore. ‘I see this work won’t do,’ said he: ‘try and
spin; perhaps you will do that better.’ So she sat down and tried to
spin; but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran. ‘See
now,’ said the fiddler, ‘you are good for nothing; you can do no work:
what a bargain I have got! However, I’ll try and set up a trade in pots
and pans, and you shall stand in the market and sell them.’ ‘Alas!’
sighed she, ‘if any of my father’s court should pass by and see me
standing in the market, how they will laugh at me!’

But her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if she
did not wish to die of hunger. At first the trade went well; for many
people, seeing such a beautiful woman, went to buy her wares, and paid
their money without thinking of taking away the goods. They lived on
this as long as it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of
ware, and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market; but
a drunken soldier soon came by, and rode his horse against her stall,
and broke all her goods into a thousand pieces. Then she began to cry,
and knew not what to do. ‘Ah! what will become of me?’ said she; ‘what
will my husband say?’ So she ran home and told him all. ‘Who would
have thought you would have been so silly,’ said he, ‘as to put an
earthenware stall in the corner of the market, where everybody passes?
but let us have no more crying; I see you are not fit for this sort of
work, so I have been to the king’s palace, and asked if they did not
want a kitchen-maid; and they say they will take you, and there you will
have plenty to eat.’

Thus the princess became a kitchen-maid, and helped the cook to do all
the dirtiest work; but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat
that was left, and on this they lived.

She had not been there long before she heard that the king’s eldest son
was passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the windows
and looked out. Everything was ready, and all the pomp and brightness of
the court was there. Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly
which had brought her so low. And the servants gave her some of the rich
meats, which she put into her basket to take home.

All on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king’s son in golden
clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her
by the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she
trembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was
making sport of her. However, he kept fast hold, and led her in; and the
cover of the basket came off, so that the meats in it fell about. Then
everybody laughed and jeered at her; and she was so abashed, that she
wished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth. She sprang to the
door to run away; but on the steps King Grisly-beard overtook her, and
brought her back and said, ‘Fear me not! I am the fiddler who has lived
with you in the hut. I brought you there because I really loved you. I
am also the soldier that overset your stall. I have done all this only
to cure you of your silly pride, and to show you the folly of your
ill-treatment of me. Now all is over: you have learnt wisdom, and it is
time to hold our marriage feast.’

Then the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes; and
her father and his whole court were there already, and welcomed her home
on her marriage. Joy was in every face and every heart. The feast was
grand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish that you
and I had been of the party.
There was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie. And
when she had grown up her father said: ‘We will get her married.’ ‘Yes,’
said the mother, ‘if only someone would come who would have her.’ At
length a man came from a distance and wooed her, who was called Hans;
but he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really smart. ‘Oh,’ said
the father, ‘she has plenty of good sense’; and the mother said: ‘Oh,
she can see the wind coming up the street, and hear the flies coughing.’
‘Well,’ said Hans, ‘if she is not really smart, I won’t have her.’ When
they were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said: ‘Elsie, go
into the cellar and fetch some beer.’ Then Clever Elsie took the pitcher
from the wall, went into the cellar, and tapped the lid briskly as she
went, so that the time might not appear long. When she was below she
fetched herself a chair, and set it before the barrel so that she had
no need to stoop, and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected
injury. Then she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and
while the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle, but
looked up at the wall, and after much peering here and there, saw a
pick-axe exactly above her, which the masons had accidentally left
there.

Then Clever Elsie began to weep and said: ‘If I get Hans, and we have
a child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to draw
beer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then she
sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the
misfortune which lay before her. Those upstairs waited for the drink,
but Clever Elsie still did not come. Then the woman said to the servant:
‘Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is.’ The maid went and
found her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly. ‘Elsie why
do you weep?’ asked the maid. ‘Ah,’ she answered, ‘have I not reason to
weep? If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to
draw beer here, the pick-axe will perhaps fall on his head, and kill
him.’ Then said the maid: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down
beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune. After a while,
as the maid did not come back, and those upstairs were thirsty for the
beer, the man said to the boy: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see
where Elsie and the girl are.’ The boy went down, and there sat Clever
Elsie and the girl both weeping together. Then he asked: ‘Why are you
weeping?’ ‘Ah,’ said Elsie, ‘have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans,
and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the
pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then said the boy: ‘What
a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down by her, and likewise began to
howl loudly. Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he still did not
return, the man said to the woman: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see
where Elsie is!’ The woman went down, and found all three in the midst
of their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then Elsie told
her also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it
grew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down. Then said the
mother likewise: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down and wept
with them. The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not
come back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said: ‘I must go into the
cellar myself and see where Elsie is.’ But when he got into the cellar,
and they were all sitting together crying, and he heard the reason, and
that Elsie’s child was the cause, and the Elsie might perhaps bring one
into the world some day, and that he might be killed by the pick-axe, if
he should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very
time when it fell down, he cried: ‘Oh, what a clever Elsie!’ and sat
down, and likewise wept with them. The bridegroom stayed upstairs alone
for a long time; then as no one would come back he thought: ‘They must be
waiting for me below: I too must go there and see what they are about.’
When he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting
quite piteously, each out-doing the other. ‘What misfortune has happened
then?’ asked he. ‘Ah, dear Hans,’ said Elsie, ‘if we marry each other
and have a child, and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw
something to drink, then the pick-axe which has been left up there might
dash his brains out if it were to fall down, so have we not reason to
weep?’ ‘Come,’ said Hans, ‘more understanding than that is not needed
for my household, as you are such a clever Elsie, I will have you,’ and
seized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her.

After Hans had had her some time, he said: ‘Wife, I am going out to work
and earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the corn that we
may have some bread.’ ‘Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.’ After Hans had
gone away, she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field
with her. When she came to the field she said to herself: ‘What shall I
do; shall I cut first, or shall I eat first? Oh, I will eat first.’ Then
she drank her cup of broth and when she was fully satisfied, she once
more said: ‘What shall I do? Shall I cut first, or shall I sleep first?
I will sleep first.’ Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep.
Hans had been at home for a long time, but Elsie did not come; then said
he: ‘What a clever Elsie I have; she is so industrious that she does not
even come home to eat.’ But when evening came and she still stayed away,
Hans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she
was lying among the corn asleep. Then Hans hastened home and brought
a fowler’s net with little bells and hung it round about her, and she
still went on sleeping. Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat
down in his chair and worked. At length, when it was quite dark, Clever
Elsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about
her, and the bells rang at each step which she took. Then she was
alarmed, and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie or
not, and said: ‘Is it I, or is it not I?’ But she knew not what answer
to make to this, and stood for a time in doubt; at length she thought:
‘I will go home and ask if it be I, or if it be not I, they will be sure
to know.’ She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut; then
she knocked at the window and cried: ‘Hans, is Elsie within?’ ‘Yes,’
answered Hans, ‘she is within.’ Hereupon she was terrified, and said:
‘Ah, heavens! Then it is not I,’ and went to another door; but when the
people heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it, and she
could get in nowhere. Then she ran out of the village, and no one has
seen her since.

","In a far-off land, there lived a king with a daughter so beautiful that all the princes of neighboring lands came to ask for her hand. But she was proud and haughty, and she made sport of them, and no one was good enough for her.

One day, the king held a great feast, and all his suitors were invited. They sat in a row, according to their rank, from kings to knights. The princess came in, and as she passed by them, she had something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat: ‘He’s as round as a tub,’ she said. The next was too tall: ‘What a maypole!’ she said. The next was too short: ‘What a dumpling!’ she said. The fourth was too pale, and she called him ‘Wallface.’ The fifth was too red, so she called him ‘Coxcomb.’ The sixth was not straight enough; so she said he was like a green stick, that had been laid to dry over a baker’s oven. And thus she had some joke to crack upon every one: but she laughed more than all at a good king who was there. ‘Look at him,’ she said; ‘his beard is like an old mop; he shall be called Grisly-beard.’

The king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved, and how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or unwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that came to the door.

Two days after, there came by a travelling musician, who began to play under the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said, ‘Let him come in.’ So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when he had sung before the king and the princess, he begged a boon. Then the king said, ‘You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for your wife.’ The princess begged and prayed; but the king said, ‘I have sworn to give you to the first comer, and I will keep my word.’ So words and tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married to the musician. When this was over, the musician went his way, and took her with him, and they soon came to a great wood. ‘Pray,’ said she, ‘whose is this wood?’ ‘It belongs to King Grisly-beard,’ answered he; ‘hadst thou taken him, all had been thine.’ ‘Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘would that I had married King Grisly-beard!’

Thus they lived for two days, and when they had eaten up all there was in the cottage, the man said, ‘Wife, we can’t go on thus, spending money and earning nothing. You must learn to weave baskets.’ Then he went out and cut willows, and brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made her fingers very sore. ‘I see this work won’t do,’ said he: ‘try and spin; perhaps you will do that better.’ So she sat down and tried to spin; but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran. ‘See now,’ said the musician, ‘you are good for nothing; you can do no work: what a bargain I have got! However, I’ll try and set up a trade in pots and pans, and you shall stand in the market and sell them.’ ‘Alas!’ sighed she, ‘if any of my father’s court should pass by and see me standing in the market, how they will laugh at me!’

At last they came to a small cottage. ‘What a paltry place!’ said she; ‘to whom does that little dirty hole belong?’ Then the musician said, ‘That is your and my house, where we are to live.’ ‘Where are your servants?’ cried she. ‘What do we want with servants?’ said he; ‘you must do for yourself whatever is to be done. Now make the fire, and put on water and cook my supper, for I am very tired.’ But the princess knew nothing of making fires and cooking, and the musician was forced to help her. When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the musician called her up very early in the morning to clean the house. Thus they lived for two days; and when they had eaten up all there was in the cottage, the man said, ‘Wife, we can’t go on thus, spending money and earning nothing. You must learn to weave baskets.’

Long, long ago, some two thousand years or so, there lived a rich
man with a good and beautiful wife. They loved each other dearly, but
sorrowed much that they had no children. So greatly did they desire
to have one, that the wife prayed for it day and night, but still they
remained childless.

In front of the house there was a court, in which grew a juniper-tree.
One winter’s day the wife stood under the tree to peel some apples, and
as she was peeling them, she cut her finger, and the blood fell on the
snow. ‘Ah,’ sighed the woman heavily, ‘if I had but a child, as red as
blood and as white as snow,’ and as she spoke the words, her heart grew
light within her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and
she returned to the house feeling glad and comforted. A month passed,
and the snow had all disappeared; then another month went by, and all
the earth was green. So the months followed one another, and first the
trees budded in the woods, and soon the green branches grew thickly
intertwined, and then the blossoms began to fall. Once again the wife
stood under the juniper-tree, and it was so full of sweet scent that her
heart leaped for joy, and she was so overcome with her happiness, that
she fell on her knees. Presently the fruit became round and firm, and
she was glad and at peace; but when they were fully ripe she picked the
berries and ate eagerly of them, and then she grew sad and ill. A little
while later she called her husband, and said to him, weeping. ‘If I
die, bury me under the juniper-tree.’ Then she felt comforted and happy
again, and before another month had passed she had a little child, and
when she saw that it was as white as snow and as red as blood, her joy
was so great that she died.

Her husband buried her under the juniper-tree, and wept bitterly for
her. By degrees, however, his sorrow grew less, and although at times he
still grieved over his loss, he was able to go about as usual, and later
on he married again.

He now had a little daughter born to him; the child of his first wife
was a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow. The mother
loved her daughter very much, and when she looked at her and then looked
at the boy, it pierced her heart to think that he would always stand in
the way of her own child, and she was continually thinking how she could
get the whole of the property for her. This evil thought took possession
of her more and more, and made her behave very unkindly to the boy. She
drove him from place to place with cuffings and buffetings, so that the
poor child went about in fear, and had no peace from the time he left
school to the time he went back.

One day the little daughter came running to her mother in the
store-room, and said, ‘Mother, give me an apple.’ ‘Yes, my child,’ said
the wife, and she gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest; the chest
had a very heavy lid and a large iron lock.

‘Mother,’ said the little daughter again, ‘may not brother have one
too?’ The mother was angry at this, but she answered, ‘Yes, when he
comes out of school.’

Just then she looked out of the window and saw him coming, and it seemed
as if an evil spirit entered into her, for she snatched the apple out
of her little daughter’s hand, and said, ‘You shall not have one before
your brother.’ She threw the apple into the chest and shut it to. The
little boy now came in, and the evil spirit in the wife made her say
kindly to him, ‘My son, will you have an apple?’ but she gave him a
wicked look. ‘Mother,’ said the boy, ‘how dreadful you look! Yes, give
me an apple.’ The thought came to her that she would kill him. ‘Come
with me,’ she said, and she lifted up the lid of the chest; ‘take one
out for yourself.’ And as he bent over to do so, the evil spirit urged
her, and crash! down went the lid, and off went the little boy’s head.
Then she was overwhelmed with fear at the thought of what she had done.
‘If only I can prevent anyone knowing that I did it,’ she thought. So
she went upstairs to her room, and took a white handkerchief out of
her top drawer; then she set the boy’s head again on his shoulders, and
bound it with the handkerchief so that nothing could be seen, and placed
him on a chair by the door with an apple in his hand.

Soon after this, little Marleen came up to her mother who was stirring
a pot of boiling water over the fire, and said, ‘Mother, brother is
sitting by the door with an apple in his hand, and he looks so pale;
and when I asked him to give me the apple, he did not answer, and that
frightened me.’

‘Go to him again,’ said her mother, ‘and if he does not answer, give him
a box on the ear.’ So little Marleen went, and said, ‘Brother, give me
that apple,’ but he did not say a word; then she gave him a box on the
ear, and his head rolled off. She was so terrified at this, that she ran
crying and screaming to her mother. ‘Oh!’ she said, ‘I have knocked off
brother’s head,’ and then she wept and wept, and nothing would stop her.

‘What have you done!’ said her mother, ‘but no one must know about it,
so you must keep silence; what is done can’t be undone; we will make
him into puddings.’ And she took the little boy and cut him up, made him
into puddings, and put him in the pot. But Marleen stood looking on,
and wept and wept, and her tears fell into the pot, so that there was no
need of salt.

Presently the father came home and sat down to his dinner; he asked,
‘Where is my son?’ The mother said nothing, but gave him a large dish of
black pudding, and Marleen still wept without ceasing.

The father again asked, ‘Where is my son?’

‘Oh,’ answered the wife, ‘he is gone into the country to his mother’s
great uncle; he is going to stay there some time.’

‘What has he gone there for, and he never even said goodbye to me!’

‘Well, he likes being there, and he told me he should be away quite six
weeks; he is well looked after there.’

‘I feel very unhappy about it,’ said the husband, ‘in case it should not
be all right, and he ought to have said goodbye to me.’

With this he went on with his dinner, and said, ‘Little Marleen, why do
you weep? Brother will soon be back.’ Then he asked his wife for more
pudding, and as he ate, he threw the bones under the table.

Little Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out of
her bottom drawer, and in it she wrapped all the bones from under the
table and carried them outside, and all the time she did nothing but
weep. Then she laid them in the green grass under the juniper-tree, and
she had no sooner done so, then all her sadness seemed to leave her,
and she wept no more. And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the
branches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and
then together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for
joy. After this a mist came round the tree, and in the midst of it there
was a burning as of fire, and out of the fire there flew a beautiful
bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently, and when it
could no more be seen, the juniper-tree stood there as before, and the
silk handkerchief and the bones were gone.

Little Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother were
still alive, and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to
the table and ate.

The bird flew away and alighted on the house of a goldsmith and began to
sing:

 ‘My mother killed her little son;
  My father grieved when I was gone;
  My sister loved me best of all;
  She laid her kerchief over me,
  And took my bones that they might lie
  Underneath the juniper-tree
  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’

The goldsmith was in his workshop making a gold chain, when he heard the
song of the bird on his roof. He thought it so beautiful that he got
up and ran out, and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his
slippers. But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on
one foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still
held the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing
up at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.

‘Bird,’ he said, ‘how beautifully you sing! Sing me that song again.’

‘Nay,’ said the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing. Give that gold
chain, and I will sing it you again.’

‘Here is the chain, take it,’ said the goldsmith. ‘Only sing me that
again.’

The bird flew down and took the gold chain in his right claw, and then
he alighted again in front of the goldsmith and sang:

 ‘My mother killed her little son;
  My father grieved when I was gone;
  My sister loved me best of all;
  She laid her kerchief over me,
  And took my bones that they might lie
  Underneath the juniper-tree
  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’

Then he flew away, and settled on the roof of a shoemaker’s house and
sang:

 ‘My mother killed her little son;
  My father grieved when I was gone;
  My sister loved me best of all;
  She laid her kerchief over me,
  And took my bones that they might lie
  Underneath the juniper-tree
  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’

The shoemaker heard him, and he jumped up and ran out in his
shirt-sleeves, and stood looking up at the bird on the roof with his
hand over his eyes to keep himself from being blinded by the sun.

‘Bird,’ he said, ‘how beautifully you sing!’ Then he called through the
door to his wife: ‘Wife, come out; here is a bird, come and look at it
and hear how beautifully it sings.’ Then he called his daughter and the
children, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all ran up the
street to look at the bird, and saw how splendid it was with its red
and green feathers, and its neck like burnished gold, and eyes like two
bright stars in its head.

‘Bird,’ said the shoemaker, ‘sing me that song again.’

‘Nay,’ answered the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing; you must
give me something.’

‘Wife,’ said the man, ‘go into the garret; on the upper shelf you will
see a pair of red shoes; bring them to me.’ The wife went in and fetched
the shoes.

‘There, bird,’ said the shoemaker, ‘now sing me that song again.’

The bird flew down and took the red shoes in his left claw, and then he
went back to the roof and sang:

 ‘My mother killed her little son;
  My father grieved when I was gone;
  My sister loved me best of all;
  She laid her kerchief over me,
  And took my bones that they might lie
  Underneath the juniper-tree
  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’

When he had finished, he flew away. He had the chain in his right claw
and the shoes in his left, and he flew right away to a mill, and the
mill went ‘Click clack, click clack, click clack.’ Inside the mill were
twenty of the miller’s men hewing a stone, and as they went ‘Hick hack,
hick hack, hick hack,’ the mill went ‘Click clack, click clack, click
clack.’

The bird settled on a lime-tree in front of the mill and sang:

 ‘My mother killed her little son;

then one of the men left off,

  My father grieved when I was gone;

two more men left off and listened,

  My sister loved me best of all;

then four more left off,

  She laid her kerchief over me,
  And took my bones that they might lie

now there were only eight at work,

  Underneath

And now only five,

  the juniper-tree.

And now only one,

  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’

then he looked up and the last one had left off work.

‘Bird,’ he said, ‘what a beautiful song that is you sing! Let me hear it
too; sing it again.’

‘Nay,’ answered the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing; give me that
millstone, and I will sing it again.’

‘If it belonged to me alone,’ said the man, ‘you should have it.’

‘Yes, yes,’ said the others: ‘if he will sing again, he can have it.’

The bird came down, and all the twenty millers set to and lifted up the
stone with a beam; then the bird put his head through the hole and took
the stone round his neck like a collar, and flew back with it to the
tree and sang--

 ‘My mother killed her little son;
  My father grieved when I was gone;
  My sister loved me best of all;
  She laid her kerchief over me,
  And took my bones that they might lie
  Underneath the juniper-tree
  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’

And when he had finished his song, he spread his wings, and with the
chain in his right claw, the shoes in his left, and the millstone round
his neck, he flew right away to his father’s house.

The father, the mother, and little Marleen were having their dinner.

‘How lighthearted I feel,’ said the father, ‘so pleased and cheerful.’

‘And I,’ said the mother, ‘I feel so uneasy, as if a heavy thunderstorm
were coming.’

But little Marleen sat and wept and wept.

Then the bird came flying towards the house and settled on the roof.

‘I do feel so happy,’ said the father, ‘and how beautifully the sun
shines; I feel just as if I were going to see an old friend again.’

‘Ah!’ said the wife, ‘and I am so full of distress and uneasiness that
my teeth chatter, and I feel as if there were a fire in my veins,’ and
she tore open her dress; and all the while little Marleen sat in the
corner and wept, and the plate on her knees was wet with her tears.

The bird now flew to the juniper-tree and began singing:

 ‘My mother killed her little son;

the mother shut her eyes and her ears, that she might see and hear
nothing, but there was a roaring sound in her ears like that of a
violent storm, and in her eyes a burning and flashing like lightning:

  My father grieved when I was gone;

‘Look, mother,’ said the man, ‘at the beautiful bird that is singing so
magnificently; and how warm and bright the sun is, and what a delicious
scent of spice in the air!’

  My sister loved me best of all;

then little Marleen laid her head down on her knees and sobbed.

‘I must go outside and see the bird nearer,’ said the man.

‘Ah, do not go!’ cried the wife. ‘I feel as if the whole house were in
flames!’

But the man went out and looked at the bird.

 She laid her kerchief over me,
 And took my bones that they might lie
 Underneath the juniper-tree
 Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’

With that the bird let fall the gold chain, and it fell just round the
man’s neck, so that it fitted him exactly.

He went inside, and said, ‘See, what a splendid bird that is; he has
given me this beautiful gold chain, and looks so beautiful himself.’

But the wife was in such fear and trouble, that she fell on the floor,
and her cap fell from her head.

Then the bird began again:

 ‘My mother killed her little son;

‘Ah me!’ cried the wife, ‘if I were but a thousand feet beneath the
earth, that I might not hear that song.’

  My father grieved when I was gone;

then the woman fell down again as if dead.

  My sister loved me best of all;

‘Well,’ said little Marleen, ‘I will go out too and see if the bird will
give me anything.’

So she went out.

  She laid her kerchief over me,
  And took my bones that they might lie

and he threw down the shoes to her,

  Underneath the juniper-tree
  Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’

And she now felt quite happy and lighthearted; she put on the shoes and
danced and jumped about in them. ‘I was so miserable,’ she said, ‘when I
came out, but that has all passed away; that is indeed a splendid bird,
and he has given me a pair of red shoes.’

The wife sprang up, with her hair standing out from her head like flames
of fire. ‘Then I will go out too,’ she said, ‘and see if it will lighten
my misery, for I feel as if the world were coming to an end.’

But as she crossed the threshold, crash! the bird threw the millstone
down on her head, and she was crushed to death.

The father and little Marleen heard the sound and ran out, but they only
saw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot, and when these had
passed, there stood the little brother, and he took the father and
little Marleen by the hand; then they all three rejoiced, and went
inside together and sat down to their dinners and ate.

","Long, long ago, in a small village nestled between the mountains, there lived a poor blacksmith with a kind and beautiful wife. They yearned for a child, but their prayers went unanswered. One day, while the wife was working in the garden, she pricked her finger on a thorn. As the blood dripped onto the snow, she sighed, 'If only I had a child as white as snow and as red as blood.'

Months passed, and the snow melted, but the wife's longing remained. One day, as she stood under the old oak tree in the courtyard, she was overcome with a strange feeling. She felt as if her wish had been granted, and soon she was pregnant.

When the child was born, it was indeed as white as snow and as red as blood. The wife was overjoyed, but her happiness was short-lived. As the child grew, she began to favor her daughter, treating the son cruelly.

One day, the wife gave her daughter an apple, but when the son asked for one, she refused. Anger welled up within her, and she snatched the apple from her daughter's hand, intending to harm her brother. But as she raised the apple, she was overcome with fear and guilt. She threw the apple into a chest and shut it tightly.

The next day, the son came home from school, and the wife greeted him with kindness, but her eyes betrayed her wicked thoughts. The son, sensing something amiss, asked for an apple. The wife gave him a wicked look and lifted the lid of the chest. As the son bent to take the apple, the lid came crashing down, and he was killed instantly.

The wife was filled with terror and sorrow, but she knew she must hide her crime. She made puddings from her son's remains and served them to her husband and daughter. But the daughter wept and wept, and her tears fell into the pot.

That night, under the old oak tree, the Juniper Spirit appeared. It took the bones from the daughter's handkerchief and flew away, transforming into a beautiful bird. It sang a haunting song, telling of the wife's wicked deed.

The bird flew to a goldsmith's workshop, where it sang its song. The goldsmith, enchanted by the bird's beauty, offered it a gold chain in exchange for another song. The bird agreed, and as it sang, it took the chain and flew away.

The bird continued to visit various tradesmen, offering its song in exchange for treasures. Each time, it took the offered item and flew away, until it had collected a gold chain, a pair of red shoes, and a millstone.

Finally, the bird returned to the blacksmith's house. The wife, filled with fear and guilt, could no longer bear to hear the song. But her husband and daughter listened, and as the bird sang, it dropped the gold chain around the husband's neck and the red shoes at the daughter's feet.

The wife, unable to bear the truth any longer, stepped outside to confront the bird. But as she did, the bird dropped the millstone on her head, crushing her to death. The husband and daughter were filled with sorrow, but they were reunited with their lost son, and they lived happily ever after.

Once upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into
partnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well;
they lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add
considerably to their stores. The bird’s duty was to fly daily into the
wood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw
to the cooking.

When people are too well off they always begin to long for something
new. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a
fellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his
household arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a
poor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed
at home and had a good time of it. For, when the mouse had made the fire
and fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest
until it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to watch the
pot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near
dinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out
among the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered,
and salted, and ready to be served. Then, when the bird came home and
had laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had
finished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following
morning: and that was really a very delightful life.

Influenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in
the wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough,
and had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a
change, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and pray
as the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained
master of the situation, and the venture had to be made. They therefore
drew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse
to cook, and to the bird to fetch the water.

And now what happened? The sausage started in search of wood, the bird
made the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited
till the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the
sausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird
flew out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he came across
a dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate
booty, and so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained to the dog
of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for
the dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and
that was the reason his life had been forfeited.

He picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he
had seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the
best of things and to remain with one another.

So now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and,
wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and
out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the
pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having
already parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.

Presently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he
could nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood
here and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to
be found. Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down,
caught fire and began to blaze. The bird hastened to fetch some water,
but his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable
to recover himself, he was drowned.
There was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter, and as she was
grown up, he was anxious that she should be well married and provided
for. He said to himself, ‘I will give her to the first suitable man who
comes and asks for her hand.’ Not long after a suitor appeared, and as
he appeared to be very rich and the miller could see nothing in him with
which to find fault, he betrothed his daughter to him. But the girl did
not care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband.
She did not feel that she could trust him, and she could not look at him
nor think of him without an inward shudder. One day he said to her, ‘You
have not yet paid me a visit, although we have been betrothed for some
time.’ ‘I do not know where your house is,’ she answered. ‘My house is
out there in the dark forest,’ he said. She tried to excuse herself by
saying that she would not be able to find the way thither. Her betrothed
only replied, ‘You must come and see me next Sunday; I have already
invited guests for that day, and that you may not mistake the way, I
will strew ashes along the path.’

When Sunday came, and it was time for the girl to start, a feeling of
dread came over her which she could not explain, and that she might
be able to find her path again, she filled her pockets with peas and
lentils to sprinkle on the ground as she went along. On reaching the
entrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes, and these
she followed, throwing down some peas on either side of her at every
step she took. She walked the whole day until she came to the deepest,
darkest part of the forest. There she saw a lonely house, looking so
grim and mysterious, that it did not please her at all. She stepped
inside, but not a soul was to be seen, and a great silence reigned
throughout. Suddenly a voice cried:

 ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,
  Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’

The girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in a
cage on the wall. Again it cried:

 ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,
  Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’

The girl passed on, going from room to room of the house, but they were
all empty, and still she saw no one. At last she came to the cellar,
and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head from
shaking. ‘Can you tell me,’ asked the girl, ‘if my betrothed husband
lives here?’

‘Ah, you poor child,’ answered the old woman, ‘what a place for you to
come to! This is a murderers’ den. You think yourself a promised bride,
and that your marriage will soon take place, but it is with death that
you will keep your marriage feast. Look, do you see that large cauldron
of water which I am obliged to keep on the fire! As soon as they have
you in their power they will kill you without mercy, and cook and eat
you, for they are eaters of men. If I did not take pity on you and save
you, you would be lost.’

Thereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask, which quite hid her
from view. ‘Keep as still as a mouse,’ she said; ‘do not move or speak,
or it will be all over with you. Tonight, when the robbers are
all asleep, we will flee together. I have long been waiting for an
opportunity to escape.’

The words were hardly out of her mouth when the godless crew returned,
dragging another young girl along with them. They were all drunk, and
paid no heed to her cries and lamentations. They gave her wine to drink,
three glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and one of yellow,
and with that her heart gave way and she died. Then they tore off her
dainty clothing, laid her on a table, and cut her beautiful body into
pieces, and sprinkled salt upon it.

The poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind the
cask, for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her by
the robbers. One of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining on
the little finger of the murdered girl, and as he could not draw it off
easily, he took a hatchet and cut off the finger; but the finger sprang
into the air, and fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl who was
hiding there. The robber took a light and began looking for it, but he
could not find it. ‘Have you looked behind the large cask?’ said one of
the others. But the old woman called out, ‘Come and eat your suppers,
and let the thing be till tomorrow; the finger won’t run away.’

‘The old woman is right,’ said the robbers, and they ceased looking for
the finger and sat down.

The old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with their wine, and before
long they were all lying on the floor of the cellar, fast asleep and
snoring. As soon as the girl was assured of this, she came from behind
the cask. She was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers, who
were lying close together, and every moment she was filled with renewed
dread lest she should awaken them. But God helped her, so that she
passed safely over them, and then she and the old woman went upstairs,
opened the door, and hastened as fast as they could from the murderers’
den. They found the ashes scattered by the wind, but the peas and
lentils had sprouted, and grown sufficiently above the ground, to guide
them in the moonlight along the path. All night long they walked, and it
was morning before they reached the mill. Then the girl told her father
all that had happened.

The day came that had been fixed for the marriage. The bridegroom
arrived and also a large company of guests, for the miller had taken
care to invite all his friends and relations. As they sat at the feast,
each guest in turn was asked to tell a tale; the bride sat still and did
not say a word.

‘And you, my love,’ said the bridegroom, turning to her, ‘is there no
tale you know? Tell us something.’

‘I will tell you a dream, then,’ said the bride. ‘I went alone through a
forest and came at last to a house; not a soul could I find within, but
a bird that was hanging in a cage on the wall cried:

 ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,
  Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’

and again a second time it said these words.’

‘My darling, this is only a dream.’

‘I went on through the house from room to room, but they were all empty,
and everything was so grim and mysterious. At last I went down to the
cellar, and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her
head still. I asked her if my betrothed lived here, and she answered,
“Ah, you poor child, you are come to a murderers’ den; your betrothed
does indeed live here, but he will kill you without mercy and afterwards
cook and eat you.”’

‘My darling, this is only a dream.’

‘The old woman hid me behind a large cask, and scarcely had she done
this when the robbers returned home, dragging a young girl along with
them. They gave her three kinds of wine to drink, white, red, and
yellow, and with that she died.’

‘My darling, this is only a dream.’

‘Then they tore off her dainty clothing, and cut her beautiful body into
pieces and sprinkled salt upon it.’

‘My darling, this is only a dream.’

‘And one of the robbers saw that there was a gold ring still left on her
finger, and as it was difficult to draw off, he took a hatchet and cut
off her finger; but the finger sprang into the air and fell behind the
great cask into my lap. And here is the finger with the ring.’ And
with these words the bride drew forth the finger and shewed it to the
assembled guests.

The bridegroom, who during this recital had grown deadly pale, up and
tried to escape, but the guests seized him and held him fast. They
delivered him up to justice, and he and all his murderous band were
condemned to death for their wicked deeds.

There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so
the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he
did spill a little of anything.

It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to
herself: ‘He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the
world,’ she spoke to him in a friendly way. ‘Good day, dear Mr Fox,
how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard
times?’ The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from
head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give
any answer or not. At last he said: ‘Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you
piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have
you the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How
many arts do you understand?’ ‘I understand but one,’ replied the
cat, modestly. ‘What art is that?’ asked the fox. ‘When the hounds are
following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.’ ‘Is that all?’
said the fox. ‘I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain
a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will
teach you how people get away from the hounds.’ Just then came a hunter
with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top
of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. ‘Open your
sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,’ cried the cat to him, but the dogs had
already seized him, and were holding him fast. ‘Ah, Mr Fox,’ cried the
cat. ‘You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been
able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.’

","Once upon a time, a goat, a frog, and a loaf of bread, entered into partnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well; they lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add considerably to their stores. The goat’s duty was to climb trees daily and bring down fruits; the frog fetched the water, and the loaf of bread saw to the cooking.

When people are too well off they always begin to long for something new. And so it came to pass, that the goat, while out one day, met a fellow goat, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his household arrangements. But the other goat sneered at him for being a poor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed at home and had a good time of it. For, when the frog had made the fire and fetched in the water, he could retire into his little room and rest until it was time to set the table. The loaf of bread had only to be placed in the oven, and then these two waited till the goat returned with the fruits. But the goat remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the frog and the loaf of bread flew out to meet him. They had not gone far, however, when they came across a wolf who, having met the goat, had regarded him as his legitimate booty, and so seized and swallowed him. The frog and the loaf of bread complained to the wolf of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing they said was of any avail, for the wolf answered that he found false credentials on the goat, and that was the reason his life had been forfeited.

He picked up the fruits that the goat had gathered, and hopped and rolled sadly home, and told the other two all he had seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the best of things and to remain with one another.

So now the frog set the table, and the loaf of bread looked after the food and, wishing to prepare it in the same way as the goat, by placing it in the oven, he jumped into the pot; but he stopped short long before he reached the bottom, having already parted not only with his skin and hair, but also with life.

Presently the frog came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he could nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the fruits here and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to be found. Then some of the fruits that had been carelessly thrown down, caught fire and began to blaze. The frog hastened to fetch some water, but his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable to recover himself, he was drowned.

By the side of a wood, in a country a long way off, ran a fine stream
of water; and upon the stream there stood a mill. The miller’s house was
close by, and the miller, you must know, had a very beautiful daughter.
She was, moreover, very shrewd and clever; and the miller was so proud
of her, that he one day told the king of the land, who used to come and
hunt in the wood, that his daughter could spin gold out of straw. Now
this king was very fond of money; and when he heard the miller’s boast
his greediness was raised, and he sent for the girl to be brought before
him. Then he led her to a chamber in his palace where there was a great
heap of straw, and gave her a spinning-wheel, and said, ‘All this must
be spun into gold before morning, as you love your life.’ It was in vain
that the poor maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her father,
for that she could do no such thing as spin straw into gold: the chamber
door was locked, and she was left alone.

She sat down in one corner of the room, and began to bewail her hard
fate; when on a sudden the door opened, and a droll-looking little man
hobbled in, and said, ‘Good morrow to you, my good lass; what are you
weeping for?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘I must spin this straw into gold, and
I know not how.’ ‘What will you give me,’ said the hobgoblin, ‘to do it
for you?’ ‘My necklace,’ replied the maiden. He took her at her word,
and sat himself down to the wheel, and whistled and sang:

 ‘Round about, round about,
    Lo and behold!
  Reel away, reel away,
    Straw into gold!’

And round about the wheel went merrily; the work was quickly done, and
the straw was all spun into gold.

When the king came and saw this, he was greatly astonished and pleased;
but his heart grew still more greedy of gain, and he shut up the poor
miller’s daughter again with a fresh task. Then she knew not what to do,
and sat down once more to weep; but the dwarf soon opened the door, and
said, ‘What will you give me to do your task?’ ‘The ring on my finger,’
said she. So her little friend took the ring, and began to work at the
wheel again, and whistled and sang:

 ‘Round about, round about,
    Lo and behold!
  Reel away, reel away,
    Straw into gold!’

till, long before morning, all was done again.

The king was greatly delighted to see all this glittering treasure;
but still he had not enough: so he took the miller’s daughter to a yet
larger heap, and said, ‘All this must be spun tonight; and if it is,
you shall be my queen.’ As soon as she was alone that dwarf came in, and
said, ‘What will you give me to spin gold for you this third time?’
‘I have nothing left,’ said she. ‘Then say you will give me,’ said
the little man, ‘the first little child that you may have when you are
queen.’ ‘That may never be,’ thought the miller’s daughter: and as she
knew no other way to get her task done, she said she would do what he
asked. Round went the wheel again to the old song, and the manikin once
more spun the heap into gold. The king came in the morning, and, finding
all he wanted, was forced to keep his word; so he married the miller’s
daughter, and she really became queen.

At the birth of her first little child she was very glad, and forgot the
dwarf, and what she had said. But one day he came into her room, where
she was sitting playing with her baby, and put her in mind of it. Then
she grieved sorely at her misfortune, and said she would give him all
the wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off, but in vain; till at
last her tears softened him, and he said, ‘I will give you three days’
grace, and if during that time you tell me my name, you shall keep your
child.’

Now the queen lay awake all night, thinking of all the odd names that
she had ever heard; and she sent messengers all over the land to find
out new ones. The next day the little man came, and she began with
TIMOTHY, ICHABOD, BENJAMIN, JEREMIAH, and all the names she could
remember; but to all and each of them he said, ‘Madam, that is not my
name.’

The second day she began with all the comical names she could hear of,
BANDY-LEGS, HUNCHBACK, CROOK-SHANKS, and so on; but the little gentleman
still said to every one of them, ‘Madam, that is not my name.’

The third day one of the messengers came back, and said, ‘I have
travelled two days without hearing of any other names; but yesterday, as
I was climbing a high hill, among the trees of the forest where the fox
and the hare bid each other good night, I saw a little hut; and before
the hut burnt a fire; and round about the fire a funny little dwarf was
dancing upon one leg, and singing:

 “Merrily the feast I’ll make.
  Today I’ll brew, tomorrow bake;
  Merrily I’ll dance and sing,
  For next day will a stranger bring.
  Little does my lady dream
  Rumpelstiltskin is my name!”

When the queen heard this she jumped for joy, and as soon as her little
friend came she sat down upon her throne, and called all her court round
to enjoy the fun; and the nurse stood by her side with the baby in her
arms, as if it was quite ready to be given up. Then the little man began
to chuckle at the thought of having the poor child, to take home with
him to his hut in the woods; and he cried out, ‘Now, lady, what is my
name?’ ‘Is it JOHN?’ asked she. ‘No, madam!’ ‘Is it TOM?’ ‘No, madam!’
‘Is it JEMMY?’ ‘It is not.’ ‘Can your name be ?’ said the
lady slyly. ‘Some witch told you that!--some witch told you that!’ cried
the little man, and dashed his right foot in a rage so deep into the
floor, that he was forced to lay hold of it with both hands to pull it
out.

Then he made the best of his way off, while the nurse laughed and the
baby crowed; and all the court jeered at him for having had so much
trouble for nothing, and said, ‘We wish you a very good morning, and a
merry feast, Mr RUMPLESTILTSKIN!’
‘Dear children,’ said a poor man to his four sons, ‘I have nothing to
give you; you must go out into the wide world and try your luck. Begin
by learning some craft or another, and see how you can get on.’ So the
four brothers took their walking-sticks in their hands, and their little
bundles on their shoulders, and after bidding their father goodbye, went
all out at the gate together. When they had got on some way they came
to four crossways, each leading to a different country. Then the eldest
said, ‘Here we must part; but this day four years we will come back
to this spot, and in the meantime each must try what he can do for
himself.’

So each brother went his way; and as the eldest was hastening on a man
met him, and asked him where he was going, and what he wanted. ‘I am
going to try my luck in the world, and should like to begin by learning
some art or trade,’ answered he. ‘Then,’ said the man, ‘go with me, and
I will teach you to become the cunningest thief that ever was.’ ‘No,’
said the other, ‘that is not an honest calling, and what can one look
to earn by it in the end but the gallows?’ ‘Oh!’ said the man, ‘you need
not fear the gallows; for I will only teach you to steal what will be
fair game: I meddle with nothing but what no one else can get or care
anything about, and where no one can find you out.’ So the young man
agreed to follow his trade, and he soon showed himself so clever, that
nothing could escape him that he had once set his mind upon.

The second brother also met a man, who, when he found out what he was
setting out upon, asked him what craft he meant to follow. ‘I do not
know yet,’ said he. ‘Then come with me, and be a star-gazer. It is a
noble art, for nothing can be hidden from you, when once you understand
the stars.’ The plan pleased him much, and he soon became such a skilful
star-gazer, that when he had served out his time, and wanted to leave
his master, he gave him a glass, and said, ‘With this you can see all
that is passing in the sky and on earth, and nothing can be hidden from
you.’

The third brother met a huntsman, who took him with him, and taught him
so well all that belonged to hunting, that he became very clever in the
craft of the woods; and when he left his master he gave him a bow, and
said, ‘Whatever you shoot at with this bow you will be sure to hit.’

The youngest brother likewise met a man who asked him what he wished to
do. ‘Would not you like,’ said he, ‘to be a tailor?’ ‘Oh, no!’ said
the young man; ‘sitting cross-legged from morning to night, working
backwards and forwards with a needle and goose, will never suit me.’
‘Oh!’ answered the man, ‘that is not my sort of tailoring; come with me,
and you will learn quite another kind of craft from that.’ Not knowing
what better to do, he came into the plan, and learnt tailoring from the
beginning; and when he left his master, he gave him a needle, and said,
‘You can sew anything with this, be it as soft as an egg or as hard as
steel; and the joint will be so fine that no seam will be seen.’

After the space of four years, at the time agreed upon, the four
brothers met at the four cross-roads; and having welcomed each other,
set off towards their father’s home, where they told him all that had
happened to them, and how each had learned some craft.

Then, one day, as they were sitting before the house under a very high
tree, the father said, ‘I should like to try what each of you can do in
this way.’ So he looked up, and said to the second son, ‘At the top of
this tree there is a chaffinch’s nest; tell me how many eggs there are
in it.’ The star-gazer took his glass, looked up, and said, ‘Five.’
‘Now,’ said the father to the eldest son, ‘take away the eggs without
letting the bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them know
anything of what you are doing.’ So the cunning thief climbed up the
tree, and brought away to his father the five eggs from under the bird;
and it never saw or felt what he was doing, but kept sitting on at its
ease. Then the father took the eggs, and put one on each corner of the
table, and the fifth in the middle, and said to the huntsman, ‘Cut all
the eggs in two pieces at one shot.’ The huntsman took up his bow, and
at one shot struck all the five eggs as his father wished.

‘Now comes your turn,’ said he to the young tailor; ‘sew the eggs and
the young birds in them together again, so neatly that the shot shall
have done them no harm.’ Then the tailor took his needle, and sewed the
eggs as he was told; and when he had done, the thief was sent to take
them back to the nest, and put them under the bird without its knowing
it. Then she went on sitting, and hatched them: and in a few days they
crawled out, and had only a little red streak across their necks, where
the tailor had sewn them together.

‘Well done, sons!’ said the old man; ‘you have made good use of your
time, and learnt something worth the knowing; but I am sure I do not
know which ought to have the prize. Oh, that a time might soon come for
you to turn your skill to some account!’

Not long after this there was a great bustle in the country; for the
king’s daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon, and the king
mourned over his loss day and night, and made it known that whoever
brought her back to him should have her for a wife. Then the four
brothers said to each other, ‘Here is a chance for us; let us try
what we can do.’ And they agreed to see whether they could not set the
princess free. ‘I will soon find out where she is, however,’ said the
star-gazer, as he looked through his glass; and he soon cried out, ‘I
see her afar off, sitting upon a rock in the sea, and I can spy the
dragon close by, guarding her.’ Then he went to the king, and asked for
a ship for himself and his brothers; and they sailed together over the
sea, till they came to the right place. There they found the princess
sitting, as the star-gazer had said, on the rock; and the dragon was
lying asleep, with his head upon her lap. ‘I dare not shoot at him,’
said the huntsman, ‘for I should kill the beautiful young lady also.’
‘Then I will try my skill,’ said the thief, and went and stole her away
from under the dragon, so quietly and gently that the beast did not know
it, but went on snoring.

Then away they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards the
ship; but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the air; for
he awoke and missed the princess. But when he got over the boat, and
wanted to pounce upon them and carry off the princess, the huntsman took
up his bow and shot him straight through the heart so that he fell down
dead. They were still not safe; for he was such a great beast that in
his fall he overset the boat, and they had to swim in the open sea
upon a few planks. So the tailor took his needle, and with a few large
stitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these,
and sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked
them together so quickly that the boat was soon ready, and they then
reached the ship and got home safe.

When they had brought home the princess to her father, there was great
rejoicing; and he said to the four brothers, ‘One of you shall marry
her, but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be.’ Then
there arose a quarrel between them; and the star-gazer said, ‘If I had
not found the princess out, all your skill would have been of no use;
therefore she ought to be mine.’ ‘Your seeing her would have been of
no use,’ said the thief, ‘if I had not taken her away from the dragon;
therefore she ought to be mine.’ ‘No, she is mine,’ said the huntsman;
‘for if I had not killed the dragon, he would, after all, have torn you
and the princess into pieces.’ ‘And if I had not sewn the boat together
again,’ said the tailor, ‘you would all have been drowned, therefore she
is mine.’ Then the king put in a word, and said, ‘Each of you is right;
and as all cannot have the young lady, the best way is for neither of
you to have her: for the truth is, there is somebody she likes a great
deal better. But to make up for your loss, I will give each of you, as a
reward for his skill, half a kingdom.’ So the brothers agreed that this
plan would be much better than either quarrelling or marrying a lady who
had no mind to have them. And the king then gave to each half a kingdom,
as he had said; and they lived very happily the rest of their days, and
took good care of their father; and somebody took better care of the
young lady, than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have
her again.

","In a small village by the side of a river, there lived a humble blacksmith named Hans. He had three sons, each as different as could be. The eldest, named Karl, was quiet and thoughtful, the second, named Max, was adventurous and daring, and the youngest, named Friedrich, was clever and cunning.

One day, their father called them together and said, ""I have nothing to give you, my sons. You must go out into the world and make your own way."" So the brothers took their walking sticks and set off, each in a different direction.

After many days of travel, they came to a crossroads. ""Here we must part,"" said the eldest. ""But in three years, we shall meet again, and see how each has fared.""

Karl went to a wise old hermit who taught him the secrets of healing herbs and potions. Max joined a group of hunters and learned the art of tracking and trapping. Friedrich, however, met a strange old woman who taught him the craft of weaving enchanted tapestries.

Three years passed, and the brothers returned to the crossroads. They shared their stories, and their father marveled at their newfound skills. But one day, a great calamity struck the village. A terrible beast had taken residence in the nearby forest, and it demanded a sacrifice of one young maiden each month.

The brothers decided to confront the beast together. Karl used his knowledge of herbs to heal any wounds they might receive. Max tracked the beast through the forest, and Friedrich wove a magical tapestry that would protect them from harm.

They soon found the beast's lair, and Friedrich hung the tapestry across the entrance. Max crept inside and found the maiden, bound and gagged, in the center of the room. Karl healed her wounds, and Friedrich untied her.

But as they prepared to leave, the beast awoke and roared in fury. Max fought bravely, but the beast was too powerful. Karl and Friedrich retreated behind the tapestry, and Friedrich wove a spell to bind the beast in place.

Max continued to fight, but the beast was too strong. Just as he was about to be overwhelmed, Friedrich finished his spell and the beast was frozen in place.

The brothers returned to the village as heroes, and the maiden was hailed as a saint. Their father was proud, and the brothers lived happily ever after.

But Friedrich had one more secret. He had woven a spell into the tapestry, a spell that would awaken the beast every year on the anniversary of its defeat. And every year, the brothers would return to the forest, and Friedrich would weave a new spell to bind the beast once more.

There was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with
two oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two
talers. When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that
the doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how well he
ate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and would willingly
have been a doctor too. So he remained standing a while, and at length
inquired if he too could not be a doctor. ‘Oh, yes,’ said the doctor,
‘that is soon managed.’ ‘What must I do?’ asked the peasant. ‘In the
first place buy yourself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on
the frontispiece; in the second, turn your cart and your two oxen into
money, and get yourself some clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to
medicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for yourself with the words: “I
am Doctor Knowall,” and have that nailed up above your house-door.’ The
peasant did everything that he had been told to do. When he had doctored
people awhile, but not long, a rich and great lord had some money
stolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such
a village, and must know what had become of the money. So the lord had
the horses harnessed to his carriage, drove out to the village, and
asked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall. Yes, he was, he said. Then he was
to go with him and bring back the stolen money. ‘Oh, yes, but Grete, my
wife, must go too.’ The lord was willing, and let both of them have a
seat in the carriage, and they all drove away together. When they came
to the nobleman’s castle, the table was spread, and Crabb was told to
sit down and eat. ‘Yes, but my wife, Grete, too,’ said he, and he seated
himself with her at the table. And when the first servant came with a
dish of delicate fare, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: ‘Grete,
that was the first,’ meaning that was the servant who brought the first
dish. The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say: ‘That is
the first thief,’ and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said
to his comrade outside: ‘The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he
said I was the first.’ The second did not want to go in at all, but was
forced. So when he went in with his dish, the peasant nudged his wife,
and said: ‘Grete, that is the second.’ This servant was equally alarmed,
and he got out as fast as he could. The third fared no better, for the
peasant again said: ‘Grete, that is the third.’ The fourth had to carry
in a dish that was covered, and the lord told the doctor that he was to
show his skill, and guess what was beneath the cover. Actually, there
were crabs. The doctor looked at the dish, had no idea what to say, and
cried: ‘Ah, poor Crabb.’ When the lord heard that, he cried: ‘There! he
knows it; he must also know who has the money!’

On this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the
doctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When therefore
he went out, all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen
the money, and said that they would willingly restore it and give him a
heavy sum into the bargain, if he would not denounce them, for if he
did they would be hanged. They led him to the spot where the money was
concealed. With this the doctor was satisfied, and returned to the hall,
sat down to the table, and said: ‘My lord, now will I search in my book
where the gold is hidden.’ The fifth servant, however, crept into the
stove to hear if the doctor knew still more. But the doctor sat still
and opened his A B C book, turned the pages backwards and forwards, and
looked for the cock. As he could not find it immediately he said: ‘I
know you are there, so you had better come out!’ Then the fellow in the
stove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out,
crying: ‘That man knows everything!’ Then Doctor Knowall showed the lord
where the money was, but did not say who had stolen it, and received
from both sides much money in reward, and became a renowned man.
A certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much
to her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at
length the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.
‘But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer
from hunger,’ said the cat; ‘and you, little mouse, cannot venture
everywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.’ The good advice
was followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where
to put it. At length, after much consideration, the cat said: ‘I know no
place where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one
dares take anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar,
and not touch it until we are really in need of it.’ So the pot was
placed in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great
yearning for it, and said to the mouse: ‘I want to tell you something,
little mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has
asked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold
him over the font at the christening. Let me go out today, and you look
after the house by yourself.’ ‘Yes, yes,’ answered the mouse, ‘by all
means go, and if you get anything very good to eat, think of me. I
should like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.’ All this,
however, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to
be godmother. She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat,
began to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off. Then she took a
walk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then
stretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought
of the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home.
‘Well, here you are again,’ said the mouse, ‘no doubt you have had a
merry day.’ ‘All went off well,’ answered the cat. ‘What name did they
give the child?’ ‘Top off!’ said the cat quite coolly. ‘Top off!’ cried
the mouse, ‘that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in
your family?’ ‘What does that matter,’ said the cat, ‘it is no worse
than Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.’

Before long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She said to
the mouse: ‘You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for
a day alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a
white ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.’ The good mouse consented,
but the cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured
half the pot of fat. ‘Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to
oneself,’ said she, and was quite satisfied with her day’s work. When
she went home the mouse inquired: ‘And what was the child christened?’
‘Half-done,’ answered the cat. ‘Half-done! What are you saying? I
never heard the name in my life, I’ll wager anything it is not in the
calendar!’

The cat’s mouth soon began to water for some more licking. ‘All good
things go in threes,’ said she, ‘I am asked to stand godmother again.
The child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that
exception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only
happens once every few years, you will let me go, won’t you?’ ‘Top-off!
Half-done!’ answered the mouse, ‘they are such odd names, they make me
very thoughtful.’ ‘You sit at home,’ said the cat, ‘in your dark-grey
fur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that’s because
you do not go out in the daytime.’ During the cat’s absence the mouse
cleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat entirely
emptied the pot of fat. ‘When everything is eaten up one has some
peace,’ said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not return
home till night. The mouse at once asked what name had been given to
the third child. ‘It will not please you more than the others,’ said the
cat. ‘He is called All-gone.’ ‘All-gone,’ cried the mouse ‘that is the
most suspicious name of all! I have never seen it in print. All-gone;
what can that mean?’ and she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay
down to sleep.

From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but
when the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found
outside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: ‘Come, cat,
we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves--we
shall enjoy that.’ ‘Yes,’ answered the cat, ‘you will enjoy it as much
as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the
window.’ They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of
fat certainly was still in its place, but it was empty. ‘Alas!’ said the
mouse, ‘now I see what has happened, now it comes to light! You are a true
friend! You have devoured all when you were standing godmother. First
top off, then half-done, then--’ ‘Will you hold your tongue,’ cried the
cat, ‘one word more, and I will eat you too.’ ‘All-gone’ was already on
the poor mouse’s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang
on her, seized her, and swallowed her down. Verily, that is the way of
the world.
===
Once upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into
partnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well;
they lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add
considerably to their stores. The bird’s duty was to fly daily into the
wood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw
to the cooking.

When people are too well off they always begin to long for something
new. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a
fellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his
household arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a
poor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed
at home and had a good time of it. For, when the mouse had made the fire
and fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest
until it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to watch the
pot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near
dinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out
among the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered,
and salted, and ready to be served. Then, when the bird came home and
had laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had
finished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following
morning: and that was really a very delightful life.

Influenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in
the wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough,
and had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a
change, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and pray
as the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained
master of the situation, and the venture had to be made. They therefore
drew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse
to cook, and to the bird to fetch the water.

And now what happened? The sausage started in search of wood, the bird
made the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited
till the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the
sausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird
flew out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he came across
a dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate
booty, and so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained to the dog
of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for
the dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and
that was the reason his life had been forfeited.

He picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he
had seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the
best of things and to remain with one another.

So now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and,
wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and
out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the
pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having
already parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.

Presently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he
could nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood
here and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to
be found. Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down,
caught fire and began to blaze. The bird hastened to fetch some water,
but his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable
to recover himself, he was drowned.

It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to
herself: ‘He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the
world,’ she spoke to him in a friendly way. ‘Good day, dear Mr Fox,
how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard
times?’ The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from
head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give
any answer or not. At last he said: ‘Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you
piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have
you the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How
many arts do you understand?’ ‘I understand but one,’ replied the
cat, modestly. ‘What art is that?’ asked the fox. ‘When the hounds are
following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.’ ‘Is that all?’
said the fox. ‘I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain
a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will
teach you how people get away from the hounds.’ Just then came a hunter
with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top
of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. ‘Open your
sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,’ cried the cat to him, but the dogs had
already seized him, and were holding him fast. ‘Ah, Mr Fox,’ cried the
cat. ‘You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been
able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.’

","There was once upon a time a poor woodcutter named Hans, who lived in a small cottage with his wife and two children. One day, while out in the forest, Hans stumbled upon a talking rabbit. The rabbit offered to teach Hans a secret that would bring him great wealth. Intrigued, Hans agreed, and the rabbit told him that if he dug a hole in the ground and placed a golden coin in it every day for a year, he would find a treasure trove at the end of the year. Hans returned home, dug the hole, and began his daily ritual.

As the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, Hans's wife grew suspicious. ""Why are you always going out into the forest, Hans?"" she asked. Hans told her about the talking rabbit and the secret treasure, but his wife was not convinced. ""That sounds like a foolish trick,"" she said.

Hans continued his daily routine, but his wife's doubts began to gnaw at him. One day, while out in the forest, he encountered the talking rabbit again. ""I have been thinking, dear rabbit,"" Hans said. ""My wife does not believe in my treasure. What can I do to prove to her that it is real?""

The rabbit thought for a moment, then said, ""Go home and tell your wife that tomorrow, when you dig up the golden coin, you will find a live bird in its place. But be careful, for the bird is enchanted, and if you speak to it, it will turn back into a golden coin.""

Hans returned home and told his wife about the talking rabbit's latest instruction. His wife was skeptical, but Hans assured her that he would prove the treasure was real. The next day, Hans dug up the golden coin as usual, but instead of finding a bird, he found a small box. Inside the box was a beautiful ring, which Hans gave to his wife as a token of his love and proof of the treasure's existence.

His wife was amazed and overjoyed, and from that day on, she believed in the treasure. Hans continued to dig up the golden coins every day for a year, and at the end of the year, he found a vast treasure trove beneath the ground. Hans, his wife, and their children lived happily ever after, thanks to the talking rabbit and the secret treasure.

FIRST STORY

There was once upon a time an old fox with nine tails, who believed that
his wife was not faithful to him, and wished to put her to the test. He
stretched himself out under the bench, did not move a limb, and behaved
as if he were stone dead. Mrs Fox went up to her room, shut herself in,
and her maid, Miss Cat, sat by the fire, and did the cooking. When it
became known that the old fox was dead, suitors presented themselves.
The maid heard someone standing at the house-door, knocking. She went
and opened it, and it was a young fox, who said:

 ‘What may you be about, Miss Cat?
  Do you sleep or do you wake?’

She answered:

 ‘I am not sleeping, I am waking,
  Would you know what I am making?
  I am boiling warm beer with butter,
  Will you be my guest for supper?’

‘No, thank you, miss,’ said the fox, ‘what is Mrs Fox doing?’ The maid
replied:

 ‘She is sitting in her room,
  Moaning in her gloom,
  Weeping her little eyes quite red,
  Because old Mr Fox is dead.’

‘Do just tell her, miss, that a young fox is here, who would like to woo
her.’ ‘Certainly, young sir.’

  The cat goes up the stairs trip, trap,
  The door she knocks at tap, tap, tap,
 ‘Mistress Fox, are you inside?’
 ‘Oh, yes, my little cat,’ she cried.
 ‘A wooer he stands at the door out there.’
 ‘What does he look like, my dear?’

‘Has he nine as beautiful tails as the late Mr Fox?’ ‘Oh, no,’ answered
the cat, ‘he has only one.’ ‘Then I will not have him.’

Miss Cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away. Soon afterwards there
was another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs
Fox. He had two tails, but he did not fare better than the first. After
this still more came, each with one tail more than the other, but they
were all turned away, until at last one came who had nine tails, like
old Mr Fox. When the widow heard that, she said joyfully to the cat:

 ‘Now open the gates and doors all wide,
  And carry old Mr Fox outside.’

But just as the wedding was going to be solemnized, old Mr Fox stirred
under the bench, and cudgelled all the rabble, and drove them and Mrs
Fox out of the house.


SECOND STORY

When old Mr Fox was dead, the wolf came as a suitor, and knocked at the
door, and the cat who was servant to Mrs Fox, opened it for him. The
wolf greeted her, and said:

 ‘Good day, Mrs Cat of Kehrewit,
  How comes it that alone you sit?
  What are you making good?’

The cat replied:

 ‘In milk I’m breaking bread so sweet,
  Will you be my guest, and eat?’

‘No, thank you, Mrs Cat,’ answered the wolf. ‘Is Mrs Fox not at home?’

The cat said:

 ‘She sits upstairs in her room,
  Bewailing her sorrowful doom,
  Bewailing her trouble so sore,
  For old Mr Fox is no more.’

The wolf answered:

 ‘If she’s in want of a husband now,
  Then will it please her to step below?’
  The cat runs quickly up the stair,
  And lets her tail fly here and there,
  Until she comes to the parlour door.
  With her five gold rings at the door she knocks:
 ‘Are you within, good Mistress Fox?
  If you’re in want of a husband now,
  Then will it please you to step below?

Mrs Fox asked: ‘Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has he a pointed
mouth?’ ‘No,’ answered the cat. ‘Then he won’t do for me.’

When the wolf was gone, came a dog, a stag, a hare, a bear, a lion, and
all the beasts of the forest, one after the other. But one of the good
qualities which old Mr Fox had possessed, was always lacking, and the
cat had continually to send the suitors away. At length came a young
fox. Then Mrs Fox said: ‘Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has a
little pointed mouth?’ ‘Yes,’ said the cat, ‘he has.’ ‘Then let him come
upstairs,’ said Mrs Fox, and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding
feast.

 ‘Sweep me the room as clean as you can,
  Up with the window, fling out my old man!
  For many a fine fat mouse he brought,
  Yet of his wife he never thought,
  But ate up every one he caught.’

Then the wedding was solemnized with young Mr Fox, and there was much
rejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off, they are dancing
still.
One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went
out to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool
spring of water, that rose in the midst of it, she sat herself down
to rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her
favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and
catching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high that
she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled
along upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring. The
princess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so
deep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she began to bewail
her loss, and said, ‘Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would
give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the
world.’

Whilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said,
‘Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘what can you
do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.’
The frog said, ‘I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes;
but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off
your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball
again.’ ‘What nonsense,’ thought the princess, ‘this silly frog is
talking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though
he may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he
shall have what he asks.’ So she said to the frog, ‘Well, if you will
bring me my ball, I will do all you ask.’ Then the frog put his head
down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came
up again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the
spring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick
it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she
never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could.
The frog called after her, ‘Stay, princess, and take me with you as you
said,’ But she did not stop to hear a word.

The next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a
strange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the
marble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the
door, and a little voice cried out and said:

 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here!
  And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

Then the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw
the frog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly
frightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her
seat. The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her,
asked her what was the matter. ‘There is a nasty frog,’ said she, ‘at
the door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: I
told him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never
get out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come
in.’

While she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:

 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here!
  And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

Then the king said to the young princess, ‘As you have given your word
you must keep it; so go and let him in.’ She did so, and the frog hopped
into the room, and then straight on--tap, tap--plash, plash--from the
bottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where
the princess sat. ‘Pray lift me upon chair,’ said he to the princess,
‘and let me sit next to you.’ As soon as she had done this, the frog
said, ‘Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.’ This
she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, ‘Now I am
tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.’ And the princess,
though very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the
pillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was
light he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house.
‘Now, then,’ thought the princess, ‘at last he is gone, and I shall be
troubled with him no more.’

But she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same
tapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:

 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here!
  And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

And when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon
her pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he did
the same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was
astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her
with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head
of her bed.

He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had
changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till
some princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from
her plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. ‘You,’ said the
prince, ‘have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for
but that you should go with me into my father’s kingdom, where I will
marry you, and love you as long as you live.’

The young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying ‘Yes’ to
all this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful
horses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind
the coach rode the prince’s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed
the misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so
bitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.

They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight
horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince’s
kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great
many years.

The mother of Hans said: ‘Whither away, Hans?’ Hans answered: ‘To
Gretel.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh, I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’
‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day,
Hans. What do you bring that is good?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want to have
something given me.’ Gretel presents Hans with a needle, Hans says:
‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’

Hans takes the needle, sticks it into a hay-cart, and follows the cart
home. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’
‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘Took nothing; had something
given me.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a needle.’ ‘Where is the
needle, Hans?’ ‘Stuck in the hay-cart.’ ‘That was ill done, Hans. You
should have stuck the needle in your sleeve.’ ‘Never mind, I’ll do
better next time.’

‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,
I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to
Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What do you bring that is
good?’ ‘I bring nothing. I want to have something given to me.’ Gretel
presents Hans with a knife. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans
takes the knife, sticks it in his sleeve, and goes home. ‘Good evening,
mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ What
did you take her?’ ‘Took her nothing, she gave me something.’ ‘What did
Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a knife.’ ‘Where is the knife, Hans?’ ‘Stuck
in my sleeve.’ ‘That’s ill done, Hans, you should have put the knife in
your pocket.’ ‘Never mind, will do better next time.’

‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,
I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to
Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good thing do you
bring?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want something given me.’ Gretel presents
Hans with a young goat. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans takes
the goat, ties its legs, and puts it in his pocket. When he gets home it
is suffocated. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have
you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘Took nothing, she
gave me something.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘She gave me a goat.’
‘Where is the goat, Hans?’ ‘Put it in my pocket.’ ‘That was ill done,
Hans, you should have put a rope round the goat’s neck.’ ‘Never mind,
will do better next time.’

‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,
I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to
Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good thing do you
bring?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want something given me.’ Gretel presents
Hans with a piece of bacon. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’

Hans takes the bacon, ties it to a rope, and drags it away behind him.
The dogs come and devour the bacon. When he gets home, he has the rope
in his hand, and there is no longer anything hanging on to it. ‘Good
evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With
Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘I took her nothing, she gave me
something.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a bit of bacon.’ ‘Where
is the bacon, Hans?’ ‘I tied it to a rope, brought it home, dogs took
it.’ ‘That was ill done, Hans, you should have carried the bacon on your
head.’ ‘Never mind, will do better next time.’

‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘I’ll
behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to Gretel.
‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans, What good thing do you bring?’ ‘I
bring nothing, but would have something given.’ Gretel presents Hans
with a calf. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’

Hans takes the calf, puts it on his head, and the calf kicks his face.
‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With
Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘I took nothing, but had something
given me.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘A calf.’ ‘Where have you the
calf, Hans?’ ‘I set it on my head and it kicked my face.’ ‘That was
ill done, Hans, you should have led the calf, and put it in the stall.’
‘Never mind, will do better next time.’

‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘I’ll
behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’

Hans comes to Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good
thing do you bring?’ ‘I bring nothing, but would have something given.’
Gretel says to Hans: ‘I will go with you.’

Hans takes Gretel, ties her to a rope, leads her to the rack, and binds
her fast. Then Hans goes to his mother. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good
evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take
her?’ ‘I took her nothing.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘She gave me
nothing, she came with me.’ ‘Where have you left Gretel?’ ‘I led her by
the rope, tied her to the rack, and scattered some grass for her.’ ‘That
was ill done, Hans, you should have cast friendly eyes on her.’ ‘Never
mind, will do better.’

Hans went into the stable, cut out all the calves’ and sheep’s eyes,
and threw them in Gretel’s face. Then Gretel became angry, tore herself
loose and ran away, and was no longer the bride of Hans.

One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went
out to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool
spring of water, that rose in the midst of it, she sat herself down
to rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her
favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and
catching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high that
she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled
along upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring. The
princess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so
deep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she began to bewail
her loss, and said, ‘Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would
give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the
world.’

Whilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said,
‘Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘what can you
do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.’
The frog said, ‘I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes;
but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off
your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball
again.’ ‘What nonsense,’ thought the princess, ‘this silly frog is
talking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though
he may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he
shall have what he asks.’ So she said to the frog, ‘Well, if you will
bring me my ball, I will do all you ask.’ Then the frog put his head
down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came
up again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the
spring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick
it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she
never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could.
The frog called after her, ‘Stay, princess, and take me with you as you
said,’ But she did not stop to hear a word.

The next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a
strange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the
marble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the
door, and a little voice cried out and said:

 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here!
  And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

Then the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw
the frog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly
frightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her
seat. The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her,
asked her what was the matter. ‘There is a nasty frog,’ said she, ‘at
the door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: I
told him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never
get out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come
in.’

While she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:

 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here!
  And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

Then the king said to the young princess, ‘As you have given your word
you must keep it; so go and let him in.’ She did so, and the frog hopped
into the room, and then straight on--tap, tap--plash, plash--from the
bottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where
the princess sat. ‘Pray lift me upon chair,’ said he to the princess,
‘and let me sit next to you.’ As soon as she had done this, the frog
said, ‘Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.’ This
she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, ‘Now I am
tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.’ And the princess,
though very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the
pillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was
light he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house.
‘Now, then,’ thought the princess, ‘at last he is gone, and I shall be
troubled with him no more.’

But she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same
tapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:

 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here!
  And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

And when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon
her pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he did
the same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was
astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her
with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head
of her bed.

He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had
changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till
some princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from
her plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. ‘You,’ said the
prince, ‘have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for
but that you should go with me into my father’s kingdom, where I will
marry you, and love you as long as you live.’

The young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying ‘Yes’ to
all this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful
horses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind
the coach rode the prince’s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed
the misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so
bitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.

They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight
horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince’s
kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great
many years.
There was a king who had twelve beautiful daughters. They slept in
twelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were
shut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be quite
worn through as if they had been danced in all night; and yet nobody
could find out how it happened, or where they had been.

Then the king made it known to all the land, that if any person could
discover the secret, and find out where it was that the princesses
danced in the night, he should have the one he liked best for his
wife, and should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did not
succeed, after three days and nights, should be put to death.

A king’s son soon came. He was well entertained, and in the evening was
taken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their
twelve beds. There he was to sit and watch where they went to dance;
and, in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it, the door
of his chamber was left open. But the king’s son soon fell asleep; and
when he awoke in the morning he found that the princesses had all been
dancing, for the soles of their shoes were full of holes. The same thing
happened the second and third night: so the king ordered his head to be
cut off. After him came several others; but they had all the same luck,
and all lost their lives in the same manner.

Now it chanced that an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle
and could fight no longer, passed through the country where this king
reigned: and as he was travelling through a wood, he met an old woman,
who asked him where he was going. ‘I hardly know where I am going, or
what I had better do,’ said the soldier; ‘but I think I should like very
well to find out where it is that the princesses dance, and then in time
I might be a king.’ ‘Well,’ said the old dame, ‘that is no very hard
task: only take care not to drink any of the wine which one of the
princesses will bring to you in the evening; and as soon as she leaves
you pretend to be fast asleep.’

Then she gave him a cloak, and said, ‘As soon as you put that on
you will become invisible, and you will then be able to follow the
princesses wherever they go.’ When the soldier heard all this good
counsel, he determined to try his luck: so he went to the king, and said
he was willing to undertake the task.

He was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered
fine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led
to the outer chamber. Just as he was going to lie down, the eldest of
the princesses brought him a cup of wine; but the soldier threw it all
away secretly, taking care not to drink a drop. Then he laid himself
down on his bed, and in a little while began to snore very loud as if
he was fast asleep. When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed
heartily; and the eldest said, ‘This fellow too might have done a wiser
thing than lose his life in this way!’ Then they rose up and opened
their drawers and boxes, and took out all their fine clothes, and
dressed themselves at the glass, and skipped about as if they were eager
to begin dancing. But the youngest said, ‘I don’t know how it is, while
you are so happy I feel very uneasy; I am sure some mischance will
befall us.’ ‘You simpleton,’ said the eldest, ‘you are always afraid;
have you forgotten how many kings’ sons have already watched in vain?
And as for this soldier, even if I had not given him his sleeping
draught, he would have slept soundly enough.’

When they were all ready, they went and looked at the soldier; but he
snored on, and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were
quite safe; and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands,
and the bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open. The soldier
saw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest
leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put
on the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them;
but in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest
princess, and she cried out to her sisters, ‘All is not right; someone
took hold of my gown.’ ‘You silly creature!’ said the eldest, ‘it is
nothing but a nail in the wall.’ Then down they all went, and at the
bottom they found themselves in a most delightful grove of trees; and
the leaves were all of silver, and glittered and sparkled beautifully.
The soldier wished to take away some token of the place; so he broke
off a little branch, and there came a loud noise from the tree. Then the
youngest daughter said again, ‘I am sure all is not right--did not you
hear that noise? That never happened before.’ But the eldest said, ‘It
is only our princes, who are shouting for joy at our approach.’

Then they came to another grove of trees, where all the leaves were of
gold; and afterwards to a third, where the leaves were all glittering
diamonds. And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there
was a loud noise, which made the youngest sister tremble with fear; but
the eldest still said, it was only the princes, who were crying for joy.
So they went on till they came to a great lake; and at the side of the
lake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in them,
who seemed to be waiting there for the princesses.

One of the princesses went into each boat, and the soldier stepped into
the same boat with the youngest. As they were rowing over the lake, the
prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier
said, ‘I do not know why it is, but though I am rowing with all my might
we do not get on so fast as usual, and I am quite tired: the boat
seems very heavy today.’ ‘It is only the heat of the weather,’ said the
princess: ‘I feel it very warm too.’

On the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated castle, from
which came the merry music of horns and trumpets. There they all landed,
and went into the castle, and each prince danced with his princess; and
the soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with them too; and
when any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her, he drank it
all up, so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty. At this,
too, the youngest sister was terribly frightened, but the eldest always
silenced her. They danced on till three o’clock in the morning, and then
all their shoes were worn out, so that they were obliged to leave off.
The princes rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the
soldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the
opposite shore they took leave of each other, the princesses promising
to come again the next night.

When they came to the stairs, the soldier ran on before the princesses,
and laid himself down; and as the twelve sisters slowly came up very
much tired, they heard him snoring in his bed; so they said, ‘Now all
is quite safe’; then they undressed themselves, put away their fine
clothes, pulled off their shoes, and went to bed. In the morning the
soldier said nothing about what had happened, but determined to see more
of this strange adventure, and went again the second and third night;
and every thing happened just as before; the princesses danced each time
till their shoes were worn to pieces, and then returned home. However,
on the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a
token of where he had been.

As soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret, he was taken
before the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the
twelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would
say. And when the king asked him. ‘Where do my twelve daughters dance at
night?’ he answered, ‘With twelve princes in a castle under ground.’ And
then he told the king all that had happened, and showed him the three
branches and the golden cup which he had brought with him. Then the king
called for the princesses, and asked them whether what the soldier said
was true: and when they saw that they were discovered, and that it was
of no use to deny what had happened, they confessed it all. And the king
asked the soldier which of them he would choose for his wife; and he
answered, ‘I am not very young, so I will have the eldest.’--And they
were married that very day, and the soldier was chosen to be the king’s
heir.

Now, tell a single original traditional German folktale based on the structure and style above. Do not generate multiple stories. Only one  story should be created, and it should follow the same narrative structure as the examples above. Conclude the story with 'The End.'

","Once upon a time, in a kingdom far, far away, there lived a king with his twelve beautiful daughters. They slept in twelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were shut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be quite worn through as if they had been danced in all night; and yet nobody could find out how it happened, or where they had been.

A poor woodcutter's son soon came. He was well entertained, and in the evening was taken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their twelve beds. There he was to sit and watch where they went to dance; and, in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it, the door of his chamber was left open.

The same thing happened the second and third night: so the king ordered his head to be cut off. After him came several others; but they had all the same luck, and all lost their lives in the same manner.

Now it chanced that an old witch, who lived in a hut deep in the forest, heard of the king's offer. She had a magic cloak, which made the wearer invisible, and she thought she would try her luck. So she went to the king, and said she was willing to undertake the task.

She was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered fine royal robes to be given her; and when the evening came she was led to the outer chamber.

The princes rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the witch placed herself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the opposite shore they took leave of each other, the princesses promising to come again the next night.

When they came to the stairs, the witch ran on before the princesses, and laid herself down; and as the twelve sisters slowly came up very much tired, they heard her snoring in her bed; so they said, ‘Now all is quite safe’; then they undressed themselves, put away their fine clothes, pulled off their shoes, and went to bed. In the morning the witch said nothing about what had happened, but determined to see more of this strange adventure, and went again the second and third night; and every thing happened just as before; the princesses danced each time till their shoes were worn to pieces, and then returned home. However, on the third night the witch carried away one of the golden cups as a token of where she had been.

As soon as the time came when she was to declare the secret, she was taken before the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the twelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what she would say. And when the king asked her. ‘Where do my twelve daughters dance at night?’ she answered, ‘With twelve princes in a castle under ground.’ And then she told the king all that had happened, and showed him the three branches and the golden cup which she had brought with her. Then the king called for the princesses, and asked them whether what the witch said was true: and when they saw that they were discovered, and that it was of no use to deny what had happened, they confessed it all. And the king asked the witch which of them she would choose for her husband; and she answered, ‘I am not very young, so I will have the eldest.’--And they were married that very day, and the"

FIRST STORY

There was once upon a time an old fox with nine tails, who believed that
his wife was not faithful to him, and wished to put her to the test. He
stretched himself out under the bench, did not move a limb, and behaved
as if he were stone dead. Mrs Fox went up to her room, shut herself in,
and her maid, Miss Cat, sat by the fire, and did the cooking. When it
became known that the old fox was dead, suitors presented themselves.
The maid heard someone standing at the house-door, knocking. She went
and opened it, and it was a young fox, who said:

 ‘What may you be about, Miss Cat?
  Do you sleep or do you wake?’

She answered:

 ‘I am not sleeping, I am waking,
  Would you know what I am making?
  I am boiling warm beer with butter,
  Will you be my guest for supper?’

‘No, thank you, miss,’ said the fox, ‘what is Mrs Fox doing?’ The maid
replied:

 ‘She is sitting in her room,
  Moaning in her gloom,
  Weeping her little eyes quite red,
  Because old Mr Fox is dead.’

‘Do just tell her, miss, that a young fox is here, who would like to woo
her.’ ‘Certainly, young sir.’

  The cat goes up the stairs trip, trap,
  The door she knocks at tap, tap, tap,
 ‘Mistress Fox, are you inside?’
 ‘Oh, yes, my little cat,’ she cried.
 ‘A wooer he stands at the door out there.’
 ‘What does he look like, my dear?’

‘Has he nine as beautiful tails as the late Mr Fox?’ ‘Oh, no,’ answered
the cat, ‘he has only one.’ ‘Then I will not have him.’

Miss Cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away. Soon afterwards there
was another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs
Fox. He had two tails, but he did not fare better than the first. After
this still more came, each with one tail more than the other, but they
were all turned away, until at last one came who had nine tails, like
old Mr Fox. When the widow heard that, she said joyfully to the cat:

 ‘Now open the gates and doors all wide,
  And carry old Mr Fox outside.’

But just as the wedding was going to be solemnized, old Mr Fox stirred
under the bench, and cudgelled all the rabble, and drove them and Mrs
Fox out of the house.


SECOND STORY

When old Mr Fox was dead, the wolf came as a suitor, and knocked at the
door, and the cat who was servant to Mrs Fox, opened it for him. The
wolf greeted her, and said:

 ‘Good day, Mrs Cat of Kehrewit,
  How comes it that alone you sit?
  What are you making good?’

The cat replied:

 ‘In milk I’m breaking bread so sweet,
  Will you be my guest, and eat?’

‘No, thank you, Mrs Cat,’ answered the wolf. ‘Is Mrs Fox not at home?’

The cat said:

 ‘She sits upstairs in her room,
  Bewailing her sorrowful doom,
  Bewailing her trouble so sore,
  For old Mr Fox is no more.’

The wolf answered:

 ‘If she’s in want of a husband now,
  Then will it please her to step below?’
  The cat runs quickly up the stair,
  And lets her tail fly here and there,
  Until she comes to the parlour door.
  With her five gold rings at the door she knocks:
 ‘Are you within, good Mistress Fox?
  If you’re in want of a husband now,
  Then will it please you to step below?

Mrs Fox asked: ‘Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has he a pointed
mouth?’ ‘No,’ answered the cat. ‘Then he won’t do for me.’

When the wolf was gone, came a dog, a stag, a hare, a bear, a lion, and
all the beasts of the forest, one after the other. But one of the good
qualities which old Mr Fox had possessed, was always lacking, and the
cat had continually to send the suitors away. At length came a young
fox. Then Mrs Fox said: ‘Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has a
little pointed mouth?’ ‘Yes,’ said the cat, ‘he has.’ ‘Then let him come
upstairs,’ said Mrs Fox, and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding
feast.

 ‘Sweep me the room as clean as you can,
  Up with the window, fling out my old man!
  For many a fine fat mouse he brought,
  Yet of his wife he never thought,
  But ate up every one he caught.’

Then the wedding was solemnized with young Mr Fox, and there was much
rejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off, they are dancing
still.
Two kings’ sons once upon a time went into the world to seek their
fortunes; but they soon fell into a wasteful foolish way of living, so
that they could not return home again. Then their brother, who was a
little insignificant dwarf, went out to seek for his brothers: but when
he had found them they only laughed at him, to think that he, who was so
young and simple, should try to travel through the world, when they, who
were so much wiser, had been unable to get on. However, they all set
out on their journey together, and came at last to an ant-hill. The two
elder brothers would have pulled it down, in order to see how the poor
ants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs. But the
little dwarf said, ‘Let the poor things enjoy themselves, I will not
suffer you to trouble them.’

So on they went, and came to a lake where many many ducks were swimming
about. The two brothers wanted to catch two, and roast them. But the
dwarf said, ‘Let the poor things enjoy themselves, you shall not kill
them.’ Next they came to a bees’-nest in a hollow tree, and there was
so much honey that it ran down the trunk; and the two brothers wanted to
light a fire under the tree and kill the bees, so as to get their honey.
But the dwarf held them back, and said, ‘Let the pretty insects enjoy
themselves, I cannot let you burn them.’

At length the three brothers came to a castle: and as they passed by the
stables they saw fine horses standing there, but all were of marble, and
no man was to be seen. Then they went through all the rooms, till they
came to a door on which were three locks: but in the middle of the door
was a wicket, so that they could look into the next room. There they saw
a little grey old man sitting at a table; and they called to him once or
twice, but he did not hear: however, they called a third time, and then
he rose and came out to them.

He said nothing, but took hold of them and led them to a beautiful
table covered with all sorts of good things: and when they had eaten and
drunk, he showed each of them to a bed-chamber.

The next morning he came to the eldest and took him to a marble table,
where there were three tablets, containing an account of the means by
which the castle might be disenchanted. The first tablet said: ‘In the
wood, under the moss, lie the thousand pearls belonging to the king’s
daughter; they must all be found: and if one be missing by set of sun,
he who seeks them will be turned into marble.’

The eldest brother set out, and sought for the pearls the whole day:
but the evening came, and he had not found the first hundred: so he was
turned into stone as the tablet had foretold.

The next day the second brother undertook the task; but he succeeded no
better than the first; for he could only find the second hundred of the
pearls; and therefore he too was turned into stone.

At last came the little dwarf’s turn; and he looked in the moss; but it
was so hard to find the pearls, and the job was so tiresome!--so he sat
down upon a stone and cried. And as he sat there, the king of the ants
(whose life he had saved) came to help him, with five thousand ants; and
it was not long before they had found all the pearls and laid them in a
heap.

The second tablet said: ‘The key of the princess’s bed-chamber must be
fished up out of the lake.’ And as the dwarf came to the brink of it,
he saw the two ducks whose lives he had saved swimming about; and they
dived down and soon brought in the key from the bottom.

The third task was the hardest. It was to choose out the youngest and
the best of the king’s three daughters. Now they were all beautiful, and
all exactly alike: but he was told that the eldest had eaten a piece of
sugar, the next some sweet syrup, and the youngest a spoonful of honey;
so he was to guess which it was that had eaten the honey.

Then came the queen of the bees, who had been saved by the little dwarf
from the fire, and she tried the lips of all three; but at last she sat
upon the lips of the one that had eaten the honey: and so the dwarf knew
which was the youngest. Thus the spell was broken, and all who had been
turned into stones awoke, and took their proper forms. And the dwarf
married the youngest and the best of the princesses, and was king after
her father’s death; but his two brothers married the other two sisters.

The mother of Hans said: ‘Whither away, Hans?’ Hans answered: ‘To
Gretel.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh, I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’
‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day,
Hans. What do you bring that is good?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want to have
something given me.’ Gretel presents Hans with a needle, Hans says:
‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’

Hans takes the needle, sticks it into a hay-cart, and follows the cart
home. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’
‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘Took nothing; had something
given me.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a needle.’ ‘Where is the
needle, Hans?’ ‘Stuck in the hay-cart.’ ‘That was ill done, Hans. You
should have stuck the needle in your sleeve.’ ‘Never mind, I’ll do
better next time.’

‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,
I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to
Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What do you bring that is
good?’ ‘I bring nothing. I want to have something given to me.’ Gretel
presents Hans with a knife. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans
takes the knife, sticks it in his sleeve, and goes home. ‘Good evening,
mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ What
did you take her?’ ‘Took her nothing, she gave me something.’ ‘What did
Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a knife.’ ‘Where is the knife, Hans?’ ‘Stuck
in my sleeve.’ ‘That’s ill done, Hans, you should have put the knife in
your pocket.’ ‘Never mind, will do better next time.’

‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,
I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to
Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good thing do you
bring?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want something given me.’ Gretel presents
Hans with a young goat. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans takes
the goat, ties its legs, and puts it in his pocket. When he gets home it
is suffocated. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have
you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘Took nothing, she
gave me something.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘She gave me a goat.’
‘Where is the goat, Hans?’ ‘Put it in my pocket.’ ‘That was ill done,
Hans, you should have put a rope round the goat’s neck.’ ‘Never mind,
will do better next time.’

‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,
I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to
Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good thing do you
bring?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want something given me.’ Gretel presents
Hans with a piece of bacon. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’

Hans takes the bacon, ties it to a rope, and drags it away behind him.
The dogs come and devour the bacon. When he gets home, he has the rope
in his hand, and there is no longer anything hanging on to it. ‘Good
evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With
Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘I took her nothing, she gave me
something.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a bit of bacon.’ ‘Where
is the bacon, Hans?’ ‘I tied it to a rope, brought it home, dogs took
it.’ ‘That was ill done, Hans, you should have carried the bacon on your
head.’ ‘Never mind, will do better next time.’

‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘I’ll
behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to Gretel.
‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans, What good thing do you bring?’ ‘I
bring nothing, but would have something given.’ Gretel presents Hans
with a calf. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’

Hans takes the calf, puts it on his head, and the calf kicks his face.
‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With
Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘I took nothing, but had something
given me.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘A calf.’ ‘Where have you the
calf, Hans?’ ‘I set it on my head and it kicked my face.’ ‘That was
ill done, Hans, you should have led the calf, and put it in the stall.’
‘Never mind, will do better next time.’

‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘I’ll
behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’

Hans comes to Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good
thing do you bring?’ ‘I bring nothing, but would have something given.’
Gretel says to Hans: ‘I will go with you.’

Hans takes Gretel, ties her to a rope, leads her to the rack, and binds
her fast. Then Hans goes to his mother. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good
evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take
her?’ ‘I took her nothing.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘She gave me
nothing, she came with me.’ ‘Where have you left Gretel?’ ‘I led her by
the rope, tied her to the rack, and scattered some grass for her.’ ‘That
was ill done, Hans, you should have cast friendly eyes on her.’ ‘Never
mind, will do better.’

Hans went into the stable, cut out all the calves’ and sheep’s eyes,
and threw them in Gretel’s face. Then Gretel became angry, tore herself
loose and ran away, and was no longer the bride of Hans.

There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so
the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he
did spill a little of anything.

","Once upon a time, there was a young man named Karl who lived with his family in a small village. One day, Karl's father and stepmother grew tired of his constant laziness and sent him away to live with his grandmother. Karl's grandmother was a kind old woman, but she was also very poor and lived in a small hut.

Karl soon became a burden to his grandmother, eating up all of her food and never helping with the chores. One day, Karl's stepmother sent him a message, saying that she would take him back if he could bring her a valuable treasure. Karl saw his chance to return to his family's good graces and set out on a journey to find the treasure.

He wandered for many days, until he came to a great forest. In the forest, he met a wise old woman who told him that the treasure he sought was guarded by a fearsome dragon. Karl was undeterred and set out to find the dragon.

He traveled for many more days until he finally came to the dragon's lair. The dragon was indeed fearsome, with scales as hard as iron and eyes that burned like fire. But Karl was not afraid. He approached the dragon and asked for the treasure.

The dragon laughed and said, ""You think you can take my treasure? You are nothing but a puny human. I will eat you alive!""

Karl was not intimidated. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small bag of candies. ""I have something for you,"" he said to the dragon. ""If you let me have the treasure, I will give you these candies.""

The dragon was tempted by the candies and agreed to let Karl have the treasure. Karl quickly grabbed the treasure and ran away as fast as he could.

When he returned to his grandmother's hut, he was hailed as a hero. His family was amazed by his bravery and welcomed him back with open arms. From that day on, Karl was no longer a burden, but a valuable member of his family.

There was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name was
Catherine, and they had not long been married. One day Frederick said.
‘Kate! I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be
hungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale.’
‘Very well,’ said she, ‘it shall all be ready.’ When dinner-time drew
nigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and
put it on the fire to fry. The steak soon began to look brown, and to
crackle in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it:
then she said to herself, ‘The steak is almost ready, I may as well go
to the cellar for the ale.’ So she left the pan on the fire and took a
large jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. The beer ran
into the jug and Catherine stood looking on. At last it popped into her
head, ‘The dog is not shut up--he may be running away with the steak;
that’s well thought of.’ So up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough
the rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth, and was making off with
it.

Away ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran
faster than she, and stuck close to the steak. ‘It’s all gone, and “what
can’t be cured must be endured”,’ said Catherine. So she turned round;
and as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely
to cool herself.

Now all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not turned
the cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till
the cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had
happened. ‘My stars!’ said she, ‘what shall I do to keep Frederick from
seeing all this slopping about?’ So she thought a while; and at last
remembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair,
and that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale
nicely. ‘What a lucky thing,’ said she, ‘that we kept that meal! we have
now a good use for it.’ So away she went for it: but she managed to set
it down just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus
all the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. ‘Ah!
well,’ said she, ‘when one goes another may as well follow.’ Then she
strewed the meal all about the cellar, and was quite pleased with her
cleverness, and said, ‘How very neat and clean it looks!’

At noon Frederick came home. ‘Now, wife,’ cried he, ‘what have you for
dinner?’ ‘O Frederick!’ answered she, ‘I was cooking you a steak; but
while I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while
I ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale
with the sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but the
cellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!’ ‘Kate, Kate,’ said he,
‘how could you do all this?’ Why did you leave the steak to fry, and the
ale to run, and then spoil all the meal?’ ‘Why, Frederick,’ said she, ‘I
did not know I was doing wrong; you should have told me before.’

The husband thought to himself, ‘If my wife manages matters thus, I must
look sharp myself.’ Now he had a good deal of gold in the house: so he
said to Catherine, ‘What pretty yellow buttons these are! I shall put
them into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you
never go near or meddle with them.’ ‘No, Frederick,’ said she, ‘that
I never will.’ As soon as he was gone, there came by some pedlars with
earthenware plates and dishes, and they asked her whether she would buy.
‘Oh dear me, I should like to buy very much, but I have no money: if
you had any use for yellow buttons, I might deal with you.’ ‘Yellow
buttons!’ said they: ‘let us have a look at them.’ ‘Go into the garden
and dig where I tell you, and you will find the yellow buttons: I dare
not go myself.’ So the rogues went: and when they found what these
yellow buttons were, they took them all away, and left her plenty of
plates and dishes. Then she set them all about the house for a show:
and when Frederick came back, he cried out, ‘Kate, what have you been
doing?’ ‘See,’ said she, ‘I have bought all these with your yellow
buttons: but I did not touch them myself; the pedlars went themselves
and dug them up.’ ‘Wife, wife,’ said Frederick, ‘what a pretty piece of
work you have made! those yellow buttons were all my money: how came you
to do such a thing?’ ‘Why,’ answered she, ‘I did not know there was any
harm in it; you should have told me.’

Catherine stood musing for a while, and at last said to her husband,
‘Hark ye, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back: let us run after
the thieves.’ ‘Well, we will try,’ answered he; ‘but take some butter
and cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.’
‘Very well,’ said she; and they set out: and as Frederick walked the
fastest, he left his wife some way behind. ‘It does not matter,’ thought
she: ‘when we turn back, I shall be so much nearer home than he.’

Presently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there
was a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees
on each side as they passed. ‘Ah, see now,’ said she, ‘how they have
bruised and wounded those poor trees; they will never get well.’ So she
took pity on them, and made use of the butter to grease them all, so
that the wheels might not hurt them so much. While she was doing this
kind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket, and rolled down
the hill. Catherine looked, but could not see where it had gone; so she
said, ‘Well, I suppose the other will go the same way and find you; he
has younger legs than I have.’ Then she rolled the other cheese after
it; and away it went, nobody knows where, down the hill. But she said
she supposed that they knew the road, and would follow her, and she
could not stay there all day waiting for them.

At last she overtook Frederick, who desired her to give him something to
eat. Then she gave him the dry bread. ‘Where are the butter and cheese?’
said he. ‘Oh!’ answered she, ‘I used the butter to grease those poor
trees that the wheels chafed so: and one of the cheeses ran away so I
sent the other after it to find it, and I suppose they are both on
the road together somewhere.’ ‘What a goose you are to do such silly
things!’ said the husband. ‘How can you say so?’ said she; ‘I am sure
you never told me not.’

They ate the dry bread together; and Frederick said, ‘Kate, I hope you
locked the door safe when you came away.’ ‘No,’ answered she, ‘you did
not tell me.’ ‘Then go home, and do it now before we go any farther,’
said Frederick, ‘and bring with you something to eat.’

Catherine did as he told her, and thought to herself by the way,
‘Frederick wants something to eat; but I don’t think he is very fond of
butter and cheese: I’ll bring him a bag of fine nuts, and the vinegar,
for I have often seen him take some.’

When she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front door she
took off the hinges, and said, ‘Frederick told me to lock the door, but
surely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me.’ So she took
her time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she cried
out, ‘There, Frederick, there is the door itself, you may watch it as
carefully as you please.’ ‘Alas! alas!’ said he, ‘what a clever wife I
have! I sent you to make the house fast, and you take the door away, so
that everybody may go in and out as they please--however, as you have
brought the door, you shall carry it about with you for your pains.’
‘Very well,’ answered she, ‘I’ll carry the door; but I’ll not carry the
nuts and vinegar bottle also--that would be too much of a load; so if
you please, I’ll fasten them to the door.’

Frederick of course made no objection to that plan, and they set off
into the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find them: and
when it grew dark, they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there.
Scarcely were they up, than who should come by but the very rogues they
were looking for. They were in truth great rascals, and belonged to that
class of people who find things before they are lost; they were tired;
so they sat down and made a fire under the very tree where Frederick and
Catherine were. Frederick slipped down on the other side, and picked up
some stones. Then he climbed up again, and tried to hit the thieves on
the head with them: but they only said, ‘It must be near morning, for
the wind shakes the fir-apples down.’

Catherine, who had the door on her shoulder, began to be very tired;
but she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy: so she said
softly, ‘Frederick, I must let the nuts go.’ ‘No,’ answered he, ‘not
now, they will discover us.’ ‘I can’t help that: they must go.’ ‘Well,
then, make haste and throw them down, if you will.’ Then away rattled
the nuts down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried, ‘Bless me,
it is hailing.’

A little while after, Catherine thought the door was still very heavy:
so she whispered to Frederick, ‘I must throw the vinegar down.’ ‘Pray
don’t,’ answered he, ‘it will discover us.’ ‘I can’t help that,’ said
she, ‘go it must.’ So she poured all the vinegar down; and the thieves
said, ‘What a heavy dew there is!’

At last it popped into Catherine’s head that it was the door itself that
was so heavy all the time: so she whispered, ‘Frederick, I must throw
the door down soon.’ But he begged and prayed her not to do so, for he
was sure it would betray them. ‘Here goes, however,’ said she: and down
went the door with such a clatter upon the thieves, that they cried
out ‘Murder!’ and not knowing what was coming, ran away as fast as they
could, and left all the gold. So when Frederick and Catherine came down,
there they found all their money safe and sound.
A farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to
him: but he was now grown too old to work; so the farmer would give him
nothing more to eat, and said, ‘I want you no longer, so take yourself
off out of my stable; I shall not take you back again until you are
stronger than a lion.’ Then he opened the door and turned him adrift.

The poor horse was very melancholy, and wandered up and down in the
wood, seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain. Presently
a fox met him: ‘What’s the matter, my friend?’ said he, ‘why do you hang
down your head and look so lonely and woe-begone?’ ‘Ah!’ replied the
horse, ‘justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has
forgotten all that I have done for him so many years, and because I
can no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless I become
stronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can I
have of that? he knows I have none, or he would not talk so.’

However, the fox bid him be of good cheer, and said, ‘I will help you;
lie down there, stretch yourself out quite stiff, and pretend to be
dead.’ The horse did as he was told, and the fox went straight to the
lion who lived in a cave close by, and said to him, ‘A little way off
lies a dead horse; come with me and you may make an excellent meal of
his carcase.’ The lion was greatly pleased, and set off immediately; and
when they came to the horse, the fox said, ‘You will not be able to eat
him comfortably here; I’ll tell you what--I will tie you fast to
his tail, and then you can draw him to your den, and eat him at your
leisure.’

This advice pleased the lion, so he laid himself down quietly for the
fox to make him fast to the horse. But the fox managed to tie his legs
together and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength he
could not set himself free. When the work was done, the fox clapped the
horse on the shoulder, and said, ‘Jip! Dobbin! Jip!’ Then up he sprang,
and moved off, dragging the lion behind him. The beast began to roar
and bellow, till all the birds of the wood flew away for fright; but the
horse let him sing on, and made his way quietly over the fields to his
master’s house.

‘Here he is, master,’ said he, ‘I have got the better of him’: and when
the farmer saw his old servant, his heart relented, and he said. ‘Thou
shalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of.’ And so the poor old
horse had plenty to eat, and lived--till he died.

There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so
the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he
did spill a little of anything.

Now, tell a single original traditional German folktale based on the structure and style above. Do not generate multiple stories. Only one  story should be created, and it should follow the same narrative structure as the examples above. Conclude the story with 'The End.'

","There was once a woman named Agnes who had a husband named Hans. One day, Hans said, ""Agnes, I am going to the market. When I return, I will be hungry, so prepare a delicious meal for me."" Agnes agreed, and as the mealtime approached, she took a piece of beef and placed it in a pan to cook. The beef began to sizzle and crackle, and Agnes stood by, turning it with a fork. Then she said to herself, ""The beef is almost ready. I may as well go to the cellar for the wine.""

She left the pan on the fire and went to the cellar, where she tapped the wine cask. The wine flowed into a jug, and Agnes stood there, watching it. Suddenly, it occurred to her, ""The cat is not locked up. She may run away with the beef. I must go and check on her.""

Away she ran, and away ran the cat, with the beef in her mouth. Agnes chased after her, but the cat ran faster, and the beef was soon gone. ""Oh well,"" Agnes thought, ""what can't be cured must be endured."" So she turned around and went back to the house.

When she reached the kitchen, she saw that the beef was gone and the wine had spilled all over the floor. ""My stars!"" she exclaimed. ""What shall I do to keep Hans from seeing all this mess?"" She thought for a moment and then remembered that there was a sack of flour in the pantry. ""This will soak up the wine nicely,"" she said to herself.

She went to the pantry and picked up the sack of flour, but as she did so, it slipped from her hands and landed right on top of the jug of wine, spilling it all over the flour. ""Ah, well,"" she said, ""when one goes, another may as well follow."" She sprinkled the flour all over the cellar, and was quite pleased with her cleverness, thinking, ""How very neat and clean it looks!""

Hans returned from the market, and when he asked Agnes what she had prepared for dinner, she said, ""Oh Hans, I was cooking you a delicious beef dish, but while I went to draw the wine, the cat ran away with it. While I ran after her, the wine spilled all over the floor. When I went to clean it up with the sack of flour that we bought at the market, I accidentally spilled that too. But the cellar is now quite clean, and looks so nice!""

Hans was angry. ""Agnes, how could you do all this? You left the beef to cook, and the wine to spill, and then ruined the flour. You should have told me before.""

Agnes thought for a moment and then said, ""Why, Hans, I did not know I was doing wrong. You should have told me.""

Hans thought to himself, ""If Agnes manages things this way, I must look after myself."" He had a great deal of money hidden in the house, and he said to Agnes, ""What pretty gold coins these are! I will hide them in the garden, but do not touch them.""

""I won't touch them,"" Agnes promised.

As soon as Hans was gone, a group of thieves came by, and Agnes asked them if they would like to buy anything. ""We have some beautiful plates and dishes,"" she said. ""But I have no money to sell them with.""

The thieves agreed to buy, and asked Agnes to show them where the money was hidden. Agnes pointed them to the garden, and the thieves dug up the coins and ran away with them. Agnes was left with the plates and dishes, which she displayed all over the house.

When Hans returned, he asked Agnes what she had done with the money. ""Oh Hans,"" she said, ""I sold the money to those peddlers. They went and dug it up themselves. Here are the plates and dishes they gave me in exchange.""

Hans was furious. ""Agnes, what a foolish thing to do! Those were my savings! How could you do such a thing? You should have told me.""

Agnes stood quietly for a moment, and then said, ""Hans, let us go and find the thieves and get our money back.""

""Very well,"" Hans agreed. ""But take some food with you, in case we are gone for a while.""

Agnes went home and locked the door, but instead of bolting it, she took it off the hinges and carried it with her. She thought to herself, ""Hans told me to lock the door, but surely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me.""

When she reached the spot where the thieves had buried the money, she said to Hans, ""Here, Hans, here is the door itself. You may watch it as carefully as you please.""

Hans was angry, but he took the door and set it up to guard the money. Agnes then said, ""I will go and gather some firewood, so that we may have a fire to keep us warm while we wait for the thieves to return.""

She went into the forest and began to gather wood, but as she did so, she thought to herself, ""I will make a nice little bed for Hans and me out of this wood, so that we may rest comfortably while we wait."" She worked for a while, and soon had a bed ready.

Meanwhile, the thieves had returned, and when they saw the door, they said to each other, ""This is a strange thing. The door is gone, and there is no one here to guard the money.""

They searched around and soon found Agnes's bed, with Hans sleeping peacefully in it. They crept up quietly and were about to kill him when Agnes woke up and said, ""Hans, wake up! I have made us a nice bed out of this wood, and we may as well rest a while longer.""

The thieves were startled and ran away, leaving the money behind. Hans and Agnes gathered up the money and returned home, happy and content.

From that day forward, Agnes was careful with the household money, and Hans learned to be more patient with her. They lived happily ever after, and their grandchildren often spoke of the day when their grandmother had outwitted the thieves and saved the family fortune.

Once in summer-time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest,
and the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said: ‘Brother
wolf, what bird is it that sings so well?’ ‘That is the King of birds,’
said the wolf, ‘before whom we must bow down.’ In reality the bird was
the willow-wren. ‘IF that’s the case,’ said the bear, ‘I should very
much like to see his royal palace; come, take me thither.’ ‘That is not
done quite as you seem to think,’ said the wolf; ‘you must wait until
the Queen comes,’ Soon afterwards, the Queen arrived with some food in
her beak, and the lord King came too, and they began to feed their young
ones. The bear would have liked to go at once, but the wolf held him
back by the sleeve, and said: ‘No, you must wait until the lord and lady
Queen have gone away again.’ So they took stock of the hole where the
nest lay, and trotted away. The bear, however, could not rest until he
had seen the royal palace, and when a short time had passed, went to it
again. The King and Queen had just flown out, so he peeped in and saw
five or six young ones lying there. ‘Is that the royal palace?’ cried
the bear; ‘it is a wretched palace, and you are not King’s children, you
are disreputable children!’ When the young wrens heard that, they were
frightfully angry, and screamed: ‘No, that we are not! Our parents are
honest people! Bear, you will have to pay for that!’

The bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their
holes. The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream, and
when their parents again brought food they said: ‘We will not so much as
touch one fly’s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have
settled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been
here and has insulted us!’ Then the old King said: ‘Be easy, he shall
be punished,’ and he at once flew with the Queen to the bear’s cave, and
called in: ‘Old Growler, why have you insulted my children? You shall
suffer for it--we will punish you by a bloody war.’ Thus war was
announced to the Bear, and all four-footed animals were summoned to take
part in it, oxen, asses, cows, deer, and every other animal the earth
contained. And the willow-wren summoned everything which flew in the
air, not only birds, large and small, but midges, and hornets, bees and
flies had to come.

When the time came for the war to begin, the willow-wren sent out spies
to discover who was the enemy’s commander-in-chief. The gnat, who was
the most crafty, flew into the forest where the enemy was assembled,
and hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the password was to be
announced. There stood the bear, and he called the fox before him
and said: ‘Fox, you are the most cunning of all animals, you shall be
general and lead us.’ ‘Good,’ said the fox, ‘but what signal shall we
agree upon?’ No one knew that, so the fox said: ‘I have a fine long
bushy tail, which almost looks like a plume of red feathers. When I lift
my tail up quite high, all is going well, and you must charge; but if I
let it hang down, run away as fast as you can.’ When the gnat had heard
that, she flew away again, and revealed everything, down to the minutest
detail, to the willow-wren. When day broke, and the battle was to begin,
all the four-footed animals came running up with such a noise that the
earth trembled. The willow-wren with his army also came flying through
the air with such a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one
was uneasy and afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each
other. But the willow-wren sent down the hornet, with orders to settle
beneath the fox’s tail, and sting with all his might. When the fox felt
the first string, he started so that he lifted one leg, from pain, but
he bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second
sting, he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could
hold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail between his legs. When
the animals saw that, they thought all was lost, and began to flee, each
into his hole, and the birds had won the battle.

Then the King and Queen flew home to their children and cried:
‘Children, rejoice, eat and drink to your heart’s content, we have won
the battle!’ But the young wrens said: ‘We will not eat yet, the bear
must come to the nest, and beg for pardon and say that we are honourable
children, before we will do that.’ Then the willow-wren flew to the
bear’s hole and cried: ‘Growler, you are to come to the nest to my
children, and beg their pardon, or else every rib of your body shall
be broken.’ So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear, and begged
their pardon. And now at last the young wrens were satisfied, and sat
down together and ate and drank, and made merry till quite late into the
night.
There was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called
Dummling,[*] and was despised, mocked, and sneered at on every occasion.

It happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood,
and before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a
bottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.

When he entered the forest he met a little grey-haired old man who bade
him good day, and said: ‘Do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket,
and let me have a draught of your wine; I am so hungry and thirsty.’ But
the clever son answered: ‘If I give you my cake and wine, I shall have
none for myself; be off with you,’ and he left the little man standing
and went on.

But when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a
false stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go home
and have it bound up. And this was the little grey man’s doing.

After this the second son went into the forest, and his mother gave him,
like the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine. The little old grey man
met him likewise, and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine.
But the second son, too, said sensibly enough: ‘What I give you will be
taken away from myself; be off!’ and he left the little man standing and
went on. His punishment, however, was not delayed; when he had made a
few blows at the tree he struck himself in the leg, so that he had to be
carried home.

Then Dummling said: ‘Father, do let me go and cut wood.’ The father
answered: ‘Your brothers have hurt themselves with it, leave it alone,
you do not understand anything about it.’ But Dummling begged so long
that at last he said: ‘Just go then, you will get wiser by hurting
yourself.’ His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the
cinders, and with it a bottle of sour beer.

When he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise,
and greeting him, said: ‘Give me a piece of your cake and a drink out
of your bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty.’ Dummling answered: ‘I have
only cinder-cake and sour beer; if that pleases you, we will sit
down and eat.’ So they sat down, and when Dummling pulled out his
cinder-cake, it was a fine sweet cake, and the sour beer had become good
wine. So they ate and drank, and after that the little man said: ‘Since
you have a good heart, and are willing to divide what you have, I will
give you good luck. There stands an old tree, cut it down, and you will
find something at the roots.’ Then the little man took leave of him.

Dummling went and cut down the tree, and when it fell there was a goose
sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. He lifted her up, and
taking her with him, went to an inn where he thought he would stay the
night. Now the host had three daughters, who saw the goose and were
curious to know what such a wonderful bird might be, and would have
liked to have one of its golden feathers.

The eldest thought: ‘I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a
feather,’ and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by
the wing, but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.

The second came soon afterwards, thinking only of how she might get a
feather for herself, but she had scarcely touched her sister than she
was held fast.

At last the third also came with the like intent, and the others
screamed out: ‘Keep away; for goodness’ sake keep away!’ But she did
not understand why she was to keep away. ‘The others are there,’ she
thought, ‘I may as well be there too,’ and ran to them; but as soon as
she had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to her. So they
had to spend the night with the goose.

The next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set out,
without troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to
it. They were obliged to run after him continually, now left, now right,
wherever his legs took him.

In the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw the
procession he said: ‘For shame, you good-for-nothing girls, why are you
running across the fields after this young man? Is that seemly?’ At the
same time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away,
but as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast, and was himself
obliged to run behind.

Before long the sexton came by and saw his master, the parson, running
behind three girls. He was astonished at this and called out: ‘Hi!
your reverence, whither away so quickly? Do not forget that we have a
christening today!’ and running after him he took him by the sleeve, but
was also held fast to it.

Whilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other, two labourers
came with their hoes from the fields; the parson called out to them
and begged that they would set him and the sexton free. But they had
scarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast, and now there were
seven of them running behind Dummling and the goose.

Soon afterwards he came to a city, where a king ruled who had a daughter
who was so serious that no one could make her laugh. So he had put forth
a decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marry
her. When Dummling heard this, he went with his goose and all her train
before the king’s daughter, and as soon as she saw the seven people
running on and on, one behind the other, she began to laugh quite
loudly, and as if she would never stop. Thereupon Dummling asked to have
her for his wife; but the king did not like the son-in-law, and made all
manner of excuses and said he must first produce a man who could drink
a cellarful of wine. Dummling thought of the little grey man, who could
certainly help him; so he went into the forest, and in the same place
where he had felled the tree, he saw a man sitting, who had a very
sorrowful face. Dummling asked him what he was taking to heart so
sorely, and he answered: ‘I have such a great thirst and cannot quench
it; cold water I cannot stand, a barrel of wine I have just emptied, but
that to me is like a drop on a hot stone!’

‘There, I can help you,’ said Dummling, ‘just come with me and you shall
be satisfied.’

He led him into the king’s cellar, and the man bent over the huge
barrels, and drank and drank till his loins hurt, and before the day was
out he had emptied all the barrels. Then Dummling asked once more
for his bride, but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow, whom
everyone called Dummling, should take away his daughter, and he made a
new condition; he must first find a man who could eat a whole mountain
of bread. Dummling did not think long, but went straight into the
forest, where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his
body with a strap, and making an awful face, and saying: ‘I have eaten a
whole ovenful of rolls, but what good is that when one has such a hunger
as I? My stomach remains empty, and I must tie myself up if I am not to
die of hunger.’

At this Dummling was glad, and said: ‘Get up and come with me; you shall
eat yourself full.’ He led him to the king’s palace where all the
flour in the whole Kingdom was collected, and from it he caused a huge
mountain of bread to be baked. The man from the forest stood before it,
began to eat, and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished.
Then Dummling for the third time asked for his bride; but the king again
sought a way out, and ordered a ship which could sail on land and on
water. ‘As soon as you come sailing back in it,’ said he, ‘you shall
have my daughter for wife.’

Dummling went straight into the forest, and there sat the little grey
man to whom he had given his cake. When he heard what Dummling wanted,
he said: ‘Since you have given me to eat and to drink, I will give you
the ship; and I do all this because you once were kind to me.’ Then he
gave him the ship which could sail on land and water, and when the king
saw that, he could no longer prevent him from having his daughter. The
wedding was celebrated, and after the king’s death, Dummling inherited
his kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife.

It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to
herself: ‘He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the
world,’ she spoke to him in a friendly way. ‘Good day, dear Mr Fox,
how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard
times?’ The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from
head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give
any answer or not. At last he said: ‘Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you
piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have
you the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How
many arts do you understand?’ ‘I understand but one,’ replied the
cat, modestly. ‘What art is that?’ asked the fox. ‘When the hounds are
following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.’ ‘Is that all?’
said the fox. ‘I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain
a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will
teach you how people get away from the hounds.’ Just then came a hunter
with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top
of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. ‘Open your
sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,’ cried the cat to him, but the dogs had
already seized him, and were holding him fast. ‘Ah, Mr Fox,’ cried the
cat. ‘You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been
able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.’

","Once upon a time, in a dense forest, a small bird named the sparrow lived. One day, while singing his melodious tunes, he attracted the attention of a wise old owl who lived in a hollow tree nearby.

""Little bird,"" said the owl, ""your song is beautiful, but I am the true King of the forest. You must bow down to me."" The sparrow, however, was not intimidated. ""I sing for my own pleasure, not to pay homage to anyone,"" he replied.

The owl was angered by the sparrow's response and summoned all the birds and animals of the forest to wage war against the sparrow. The sparrow, however, was not afraid. He sent a clever ant to spy on the enemy's plans.

The ant, disguised as a leaf, hid beneath the tree where the enemy was meeting. The owl, who was the commander-in-chief, announced a secret password: ""When I spread my wings wide, you must attack; but if I fold them close, retreat immediately.""

The ant reported this to the sparrow, who then devised a plan. When the day of the battle arrived, the sparrow called upon a cunning fox to lead his army. The fox agreed, but on one condition: that the sparrow must give him a piece of his cake and a sip of his wine.

The sparrow, not suspecting any deceit, shared his food with the fox. As they ate and drank, the fox's cunning plan began to unfold. The fox, during the battle, was to pretend to be injured and retreat, leading the enemy into a trap.

The battle commenced, and the sparrow's army, led by the cunning fox, fought valiantly. But as the fox had agreed, he feigned injury and retreated, leading the enemy deep into the forest.

The enemy, thinking they had won, let their guard down. The sparrow, seeing this, called upon a swarm of bees to attack. The bees, stinging the enemy mercilessly, soon had them in disarray.

The owl, realizing they had been defeated, called a truce. The sparrow, however, demanded an apology and a promise that he would never again claim to be the King of the forest. The owl, humiliated, agreed.

From that day forth, the sparrow sang his melodious tunes without fear, and the forest echoed with his beautiful music. The End."

Long before you or I were born, there reigned, in a country a great way
off, a king who had three sons. This king once fell very ill--so ill
that nobody thought he could live. His sons were very much grieved
at their father’s sickness; and as they were walking together very
mournfully in the garden of the palace, a little old man met them and
asked what was the matter. They told him that their father was very ill,
and that they were afraid nothing could save him. ‘I know what would,’
said the little old man; ‘it is the Water of Life. If he could have a
draught of it he would be well again; but it is very hard to get.’ Then
the eldest son said, ‘I will soon find it’: and he went to the sick
king, and begged that he might go in search of the Water of Life, as
it was the only thing that could save him. ‘No,’ said the king. ‘I had
rather die than place you in such great danger as you must meet with in
your journey.’ But he begged so hard that the king let him go; and the
prince thought to himself, ‘If I bring my father this water, he will
make me sole heir to his kingdom.’

Then he set out: and when he had gone on his way some time he came to a
deep valley, overhung with rocks and woods; and as he looked around, he
saw standing above him on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf, with a
sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak; and the dwarf called to him and said,
‘Prince, whither so fast?’ ‘What is that to thee, you ugly imp?’ said
the prince haughtily, and rode on.

But the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell
of ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became
narrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he
could not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his
horse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing
round him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so that he was
shut in all round. He next tried to get off his horse and make his way
on foot, but again the laugh rang in his ears, and he found himself
unable to move a step, and thus he was forced to abide spellbound.

Meantime the old king was lingering on in daily hope of his son’s
return, till at last the second son said, ‘Father, I will go in search
of the Water of Life.’ For he thought to himself, ‘My brother is surely
dead, and the kingdom will fall to me if I find the water.’ The king was
at first very unwilling to let him go, but at last yielded to his wish.
So he set out and followed the same road which his brother had done,
and met with the same elf, who stopped him at the same spot in the
mountains, saying, as before, ‘Prince, prince, whither so fast?’ ‘Mind
your own affairs, busybody!’ said the prince scornfully, and rode on.

But the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he put on his elder
brother, and he, too, was at last obliged to take up his abode in the
heart of the mountains. Thus it is with proud silly people, who think
themselves above everyone else, and are too proud to ask or take advice.

When the second prince had thus been gone a long time, the youngest son
said he would go and search for the Water of Life, and trusted he should
soon be able to make his father well again. So he set out, and the dwarf
met him too at the same spot in the valley, among the mountains, and
said, ‘Prince, whither so fast?’ And the prince said, ‘I am going in
search of the Water of Life, because my father is ill, and like to die:
can you help me? Pray be kind, and aid me if you can!’ ‘Do you know
where it is to be found?’ asked the dwarf. ‘No,’ said the prince, ‘I do
not. Pray tell me if you know.’ ‘Then as you have spoken to me kindly,
and are wise enough to seek for advice, I will tell you how and where to
go. The water you seek springs from a well in an enchanted castle; and,
that you may be able to reach it in safety, I will give you an iron wand
and two little loaves of bread; strike the iron door of the castle three
times with the wand, and it will open: two hungry lions will be lying
down inside gaping for their prey, but if you throw them the bread they
will let you pass; then hasten on to the well, and take some of the
Water of Life before the clock strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer
the door will shut upon you for ever.’

Then the prince thanked his little friend with the scarlet cloak for his
friendly aid, and took the wand and the bread, and went travelling on
and on, over sea and over land, till he came to his journey’s end, and
found everything to be as the dwarf had told him. The door flew open at
the third stroke of the wand, and when the lions were quieted he went on
through the castle and came at length to a beautiful hall. Around it he
saw several knights sitting in a trance; then he pulled off their rings
and put them on his own fingers. In another room he saw on a table a
sword and a loaf of bread, which he also took. Further on he came to a
room where a beautiful young lady sat upon a couch; and she welcomed him
joyfully, and said, if he would set her free from the spell that bound
her, the kingdom should be his, if he would come back in a year and
marry her. Then she told him that the well that held the Water of Life
was in the palace gardens; and bade him make haste, and draw what he
wanted before the clock struck twelve.

He walked on; and as he walked through beautiful gardens he came to a
delightful shady spot in which stood a couch; and he thought to himself,
as he felt tired, that he would rest himself for a while, and gaze on
the lovely scenes around him. So he laid himself down, and sleep
fell upon him unawares, so that he did not wake up till the clock was
striking a quarter to twelve. Then he sprang from the couch dreadfully
frightened, ran to the well, filled a cup that was standing by him full
of water, and hastened to get away in time. Just as he was going out of
the iron door it struck twelve, and the door fell so quickly upon him
that it snapped off a piece of his heel.

When he found himself safe, he was overjoyed to think that he had got
the Water of Life; and as he was going on his way homewards, he passed
by the little dwarf, who, when he saw the sword and the loaf, said, ‘You
have made a noble prize; with the sword you can at a blow slay whole
armies, and the bread will never fail you.’ Then the prince thought
to himself, ‘I cannot go home to my father without my brothers’; so he
said, ‘My dear friend, cannot you tell me where my two brothers are, who
set out in search of the Water of Life before me, and never came back?’
‘I have shut them up by a charm between two mountains,’ said the dwarf,
‘because they were proud and ill-behaved, and scorned to ask advice.’
The prince begged so hard for his brothers, that the dwarf at last set
them free, though unwillingly, saying, ‘Beware of them, for they have
bad hearts.’ Their brother, however, was greatly rejoiced to see them,
and told them all that had happened to him; how he had found the Water
of Life, and had taken a cup full of it; and how he had set a beautiful
princess free from a spell that bound her; and how she had engaged to
wait a whole year, and then to marry him, and to give him the kingdom.

Then they all three rode on together, and on their way home came to a
country that was laid waste by war and a dreadful famine, so that it was
feared all must die for want. But the prince gave the king of the land
the bread, and all his kingdom ate of it. And he lent the king the
wonderful sword, and he slew the enemy’s army with it; and thus the
kingdom was once more in peace and plenty. In the same manner he
befriended two other countries through which they passed on their way.

When they came to the sea, they got into a ship and during their voyage
the two eldest said to themselves, ‘Our brother has got the water which
we could not find, therefore our father will forsake us and give him the
kingdom, which is our right’; so they were full of envy and revenge, and
agreed together how they could ruin him. Then they waited till he was
fast asleep, and poured the Water of Life out of the cup, and took it
for themselves, giving him bitter sea-water instead.

When they came to their journey’s end, the youngest son brought his cup
to the sick king, that he might drink and be healed. Scarcely, however,
had he tasted the bitter sea-water when he became worse even than he was
before; and then both the elder sons came in, and blamed the youngest
for what they had done; and said that he wanted to poison their father,
but that they had found the Water of Life, and had brought it with them.
He no sooner began to drink of what they brought him, than he felt his
sickness leave him, and was as strong and well as in his younger days.
Then they went to their brother, and laughed at him, and said, ‘Well,
brother, you found the Water of Life, did you? You have had the trouble
and we shall have the reward. Pray, with all your cleverness, why did
not you manage to keep your eyes open? Next year one of us will take
away your beautiful princess, if you do not take care. You had better
say nothing about this to our father, for he does not believe a word you
say; and if you tell tales, you shall lose your life into the bargain:
but be quiet, and we will let you off.’

The old king was still very angry with his youngest son, and thought
that he really meant to have taken away his life; so he called his court
together, and asked what should be done, and all agreed that he ought to
be put to death. The prince knew nothing of what was going on, till one
day, when the king’s chief huntsmen went a-hunting with him, and they
were alone in the wood together, the huntsman looked so sorrowful that
the prince said, ‘My friend, what is the matter with you?’ ‘I cannot and
dare not tell you,’ said he. But the prince begged very hard, and said,
‘Only tell me what it is, and do not think I shall be angry, for I will
forgive you.’ ‘Alas!’ said the huntsman; ‘the king has ordered me to
shoot you.’ The prince started at this, and said, ‘Let me live, and I
will change dresses with you; you shall take my royal coat to show to my
father, and do you give me your shabby one.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said
the huntsman; ‘I am sure I shall be glad to save you, for I could not
have shot you.’ Then he took the prince’s coat, and gave him the shabby
one, and went away through the wood.

Some time after, three grand embassies came to the old king’s court,
with rich gifts of gold and precious stones for his youngest son; now
all these were sent from the three kings to whom he had lent his sword
and loaf of bread, in order to rid them of their enemy and feed their
people. This touched the old king’s heart, and he thought his son might
still be guiltless, and said to his court, ‘O that my son were still
alive! how it grieves me that I had him killed!’ ‘He is still alive,’
said the huntsman; ‘and I am glad that I had pity on him, but let him
go in peace, and brought home his royal coat.’ At this the king was
overwhelmed with joy, and made it known throughout all his kingdom, that
if his son would come back to his court he would forgive him.

Meanwhile the princess was eagerly waiting till her deliverer should
come back; and had a road made leading up to her palace all of shining
gold; and told her courtiers that whoever came on horseback, and rode
straight up to the gate upon it, was her true lover; and that they must
let him in: but whoever rode on one side of it, they must be sure was
not the right one; and that they must send him away at once.

The time soon came, when the eldest brother thought that he would make
haste to go to the princess, and say that he was the one who had set
her free, and that he should have her for his wife, and the kingdom with
her. As he came before the palace and saw the golden road, he stopped to
look at it, and he thought to himself, ‘It is a pity to ride upon this
beautiful road’; so he turned aside and rode on the right-hand side of
it. But when he came to the gate, the guards, who had seen the road
he took, said to him, he could not be what he said he was, and must go
about his business.

The second prince set out soon afterwards on the same errand; and when
he came to the golden road, and his horse had set one foot upon it,
he stopped to look at it, and thought it very beautiful, and said to
himself, ‘What a pity it is that anything should tread here!’ Then he
too turned aside and rode on the left side of it. But when he came to
the gate the guards said he was not the true prince, and that he too
must go away about his business; and away he went.

Now when the full year was come round, the third brother left the forest
in which he had lain hid for fear of his father’s anger, and set out in
search of his betrothed bride. So he journeyed on, thinking of her all
the way, and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the road was
made of, but went with his horse straight over it; and as he came to the
gate it flew open, and the princess welcomed him with joy, and said
he was her deliverer, and should now be her husband and lord of the
kingdom. When the first joy at their meeting was over, the princess told
him she had heard of his father having forgiven him, and of his wish to
have him home again: so, before his wedding with the princess, he went
to visit his father, taking her with him. Then he told him everything;
how his brothers had cheated and robbed him, and yet that he had borne
all those wrongs for the love of his father. And the old king was very
angry, and wanted to punish his wicked sons; but they made their escape,
and got into a ship and sailed away over the wide sea, and where they
went to nobody knew and nobody cared.

And now the old king gathered together his court, and asked all his
kingdom to come and celebrate the wedding of his son and the princess.
And young and old, noble and squire, gentle and simple, came at once
on the summons; and among the rest came the friendly dwarf, with the
sugarloaf hat, and a new scarlet cloak.

  And the wedding was held, and the merry bells run.
  And all the good people they danced and they sung,
  And feasted and frolick’d I can’t tell how long.

","Long ago, in a far-off land, there lived a king with three daughters. This king fell gravely ill, and his daughters were filled with sorrow. As they walked together in the palace garden, they came across a wise old woman who asked them what was wrong. They told her their father was ill, and she said, ""I know what will cure him. It is the Water of Youth. If he drinks it, he will be as young as he was in his prime. But it is very hard to find."" The eldest daughter said, ""I will find it,"" and set out on her journey.

She traveled for many days and nights, and at last came to a deep valley, where she met an ugly dwarf with a sugarloaf cap and a red cloak. ""Lady,"" he said, ""where are you going so fast?"" ""I am searching for the Water of Youth,"" she replied. ""I can help you,"" said the dwarf, ""but you must be kind and ask for my help. If you are proud and haughty, I cannot help you."" The eldest daughter scoffed at the dwarf and continued on her way.

But the dwarf put a spell on her, and she was unable to move. She was trapped in the valley, unable to go back or forward. She remained there, trapped and alone, until she died.

The second daughter set out on her journey, and met the same dwarf in the same valley. He warned her not to be proud, and to ask for his help. But she too scoffed at the dwarf and continued on her way. The dwarf put the same spell on her, and she too was trapped and died.

The youngest daughter approached the dwarf with humility and asked for his help. The dwarf told her the Water of Youth could be found in a hidden castle, guarded by a fierce dragon. He gave her a magic sword and a loaf of bread, and told her to strike the castle door three times with the sword, and to throw the bread to the dragon to distract it.

The youngest daughter followed the dwarf's instructions, and entered the castle. She found the Water of Youth in a beautiful crystal vial, and filled a small bottle with it. But as she was leaving the castle, the clock struck midnight, and the door slammed shut behind her, trapping her inside.

She fought her way out of the castle, and as she emerged, she saw the dwarf waiting for her. ""You have done well,"" he said, ""but you must be careful. Your sisters were proud and haughty, and they paid the price for their arrogance. Be kind and humble, and you will be rewarded.""

The youngest daughter returned home, and gave the Water of Youth to her father. He drank it, and was restored to his youth and health. He was grateful to his daughter, and promised to reward her.

The eldest and second daughters returned home as well, but they were filled with envy and anger. They had not found the Water of Youth, and they blamed their youngest sister for their failure. They plotted to take the Water of Youth for themselves, and to leave their sister to die.

But the youngest daughter was wise and cunning. She gave them the bottle she had filled with sea water, and they drank it, thinking it was the Water of Youth. They fell ill and died, and the youngest daughter took the real Water of Youth and drank it, restoring her youth and beauty.

The king was grateful to his daughter, and made her his heir. She ruled wisely and justly, and the kingdom prospered under her rule. And the dwarf, who had helped her on her journey, came to visit her often, and they became good friends.

There was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy
wood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy could take
any shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of
an owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always
became an old woman again. When any young man came within a hundred
paces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step
till she came and set him free; which she would not do till he had given
her his word never to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came
within that space she was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her
into a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the castle. There were
seven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle, and all with
beautiful birds in them.

Now there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier
than all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd
lad, whose name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon
to be married. One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be
alone; and Jorindel said, ‘We must take care that we don’t go too near
to the fairy’s castle.’ It was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the
setting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon
the green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall
birches.

Jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and
both felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be
parted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way; and when
they looked to see which way they should go home, they found themselves
at a loss to know what path to take.

The sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk behind
the hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw through the
bushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close under the old
walls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled.
Jorinda was just singing,

 ‘The ring-dove sang from the willow spray,
  Well-a-day! Well-a-day!
  He mourn’d for the fate of his darling mate,
  Well-a-day!’

when her song stopped suddenly. Jorindel turned to see the reason, and
beheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale, so that her song ended
with a mournful _jug, jug_. An owl with fiery eyes flew three times
round them, and three times screamed:

 ‘Tu whu! Tu whu! Tu whu!’

Jorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither
weep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot. And now the sun went quite down;
the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the
old fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and
chin that almost met one another.

She mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went away
with it in her hand. Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gone--but
what could he do? He could not speak, he could not move from the spot
where he stood. At last the fairy came back and sang with a hoarse
voice:

 ‘Till the prisoner is fast,
  And her doom is cast,
  There stay! Oh, stay!
  When the charm is around her,
  And the spell has bound her,
  Hie away! away!’

On a sudden Jorindel found himself free. Then he fell on his knees
before the fairy, and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda: but
she laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then she
went her way.

He prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain. ‘Alas!’ he said, ‘what
will become of me?’ He could not go back to his own home, so he went to
a strange village, and employed himself in keeping sheep. Many a time
did he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go,
but all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.

At last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower,
and that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he
plucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and
that everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he
found his Jorinda again.

In the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale for
this pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but
on the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple
flower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly
pearl. Then he plucked the flower, and set out and travelled day and
night, till he came again to the castle.

He walked nearer than a hundred paces to it, and yet he did not become
fixed as before, but found that he could go quite close up to the door.
Jorindel was very glad indeed to see this. Then he touched the door with
the flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court,
and listened when he heard so many birds singing. At last he came to the
chamber where the fairy sat, with the seven hundred birds singing in
the seven hundred cages. When she saw Jorindel she was very angry, and
screamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him, for
the flower he held in his hand was his safeguard. He looked around at
the birds, but alas! there were many, many nightingales, and how then
should he find out which was his Jorinda? While he was thinking what to
do, he saw the fairy had taken down one of the cages, and was making the
best of her way off through the door. He ran or flew after her, touched
the cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her
arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when
they walked together in the wood.

Then he touched all the other birds with the flower, so that they all
took their old forms again; and he took Jorinda home, where they were
married, and lived happily together many years: and so did a good many
other lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy’s
cages by themselves, much longer than they liked.
A king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way off,
where there were in those days fairies. Now this king and queen had
plenty of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of
good things to eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day: but
though they had been married many years they had no children, and this
grieved them very much indeed. But one day as the queen was walking
by the side of the river, at the bottom of the garden, she saw a poor
little fish, that had thrown itself out of the water, and lay gasping
and nearly dead on the bank. Then the queen took pity on the little
fish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away
it lifted its head out of the water and said, ‘I know what your wish is,
and it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me--you will
soon have a daughter.’ What the little fish had foretold soon came to
pass; and the queen had a little girl, so very beautiful that the king
could not cease looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great
feast and make merry, and show the child to all the land. So he asked
his kinsmen, and nobles, and friends, and neighbours. But the queen
said, ‘I will have the fairies also, that they might be kind and good
to our little daughter.’ Now there were thirteen fairies in the kingdom;
but as the king and queen had only twelve golden dishes for them to eat
out of, they were forced to leave one of the fairies without asking her.
So twelve fairies came, each with a high red cap on her head, and red
shoes with high heels on her feet, and a long white wand in her hand:
and after the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave all
their best gifts to the little princess. One gave her goodness, another
beauty, another riches, and so on till she had all that was good in the
world.

Just as eleven of them had done blessing her, a great noise was heard in
the courtyard, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was
come, with a black cap on her head, and black shoes on her feet, and a
broomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the dining-hall.
Now, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and
scolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her
revenge. So she cried out, ‘The king’s daughter shall, in her fifteenth
year, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.’ Then the twelfth of
the friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift, came forward, and
said that the evil wish must be fulfilled, but that she could soften its
mischief; so her gift was, that the king’s daughter, when the spindle
wounded her, should not really die, but should only fall asleep for a
hundred years.

However, the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from
the threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom
should be bought up and burnt. But all the gifts of the first eleven
fairies were in the meantime fulfilled; for the princess was so
beautiful, and well behaved, and good, and wise, that everyone who knew
her loved her.

It happened that, on the very day she was fifteen years old, the king
and queen were not at home, and she was left alone in the palace. So she
roved about by herself, and looked at all the rooms and chambers, till
at last she came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow staircase
ending with a little door. In the door there was a golden key, and when
she turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning
away very busily. ‘Why, how now, good mother,’ said the princess; ‘what
are you doing there?’ ‘Spinning,’ said the old lady, and nodded her
head, humming a tune, while buzz! went the wheel. ‘How prettily that
little thing turns round!’ said the princess, and took the spindle
and began to try and spin. But scarcely had she touched it, before the
fairy’s prophecy was fulfilled; the spindle wounded her, and she fell
down lifeless on the ground.

However, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and
the king and the queen, who had just come home, and all their court,
fell asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in
the court, the pigeons on the house-top, and the very flies slept upon
the walls. Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went to
sleep; the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a
goose upon it for the king’s dinner stood still; and the cook, who was
at that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box
on the ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell
asleep; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the
jug at his lips: and thus everything stood still, and slept soundly.

A large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace, and every year it
became higher and thicker; till at last the old palace was surrounded
and hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen. But
there went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping Briar
Rose (for so the king’s daughter was called): so that, from time to
time, several kings’ sons came, and tried to break through the thicket
into the palace. This, however, none of them could ever do; for the
thorns and bushes laid hold of them, as it were with hands; and there
they stuck fast, and died wretchedly.

After many, many years there came a king’s son into that land: and an
old man told him the story of the thicket of thorns; and how a beautiful
palace stood behind it, and how a wonderful princess, called Briar Rose,
lay in it asleep, with all her court. He told, too, how he had heard
from his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had tried to
break through the thicket, but that they had all stuck fast in it, and
died. Then the young prince said, ‘All this shall not frighten me; I
will go and see this Briar Rose.’ The old man tried to hinder him, but
he was bent upon going.

Now that very day the hundred years were ended; and as the prince came
to the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs, through
which he went with ease, and they shut in after him as thick as ever.
Then he came at last to the palace, and there in the court lay the dogs
asleep; and the horses were standing in the stables; and on the roof sat
the pigeons fast asleep, with their heads under their wings. And when he
came into the palace, the flies were sleeping on the walls; the spit
was standing still; the butler had the jug of ale at his lips, going
to drink a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to be
plucked; and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand, as
if she was going to beat the boy.

Then he went on still farther, and all was so still that he could hear
every breath he drew; till at last he came to the old tower, and opened
the door of the little room in which Briar Rose was; and there she lay,
fast asleep on a couch by the window. She looked so beautiful that he
could not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.
But the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled
upon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also
awoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder.
And the horses shook themselves, and the dogs jumped up and barked; the
pigeons took their heads from under their wings, and looked about and
flew into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in
the kitchen blazed up; round went the jack, and round went the spit,
with the goose for the king’s dinner upon it; the butler finished his
draught of ale; the maid went on plucking the fowl; and the cook gave
the boy the box on his ear.

And then the prince and Briar Rose were married, and the wedding feast
was given; and they lived happily together all their lives long.

There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so
the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he
did spill a little of anything.

","There was once a wise old woman, who lived in a small cottage in the
middle of a dark forest. She had a beautiful garden, filled with
flowers, fruits, and vegetables, and a small pond with crystal clear
water, where she kept a few fish. The old woman was kind and gentle,
and always helped those who were in need.

One day, a young prince, who had been lost in the forest, came to her
cottage. He was dirty, tired, and hungry, and the old woman took him in
and fed him. She listened to his story, and when she heard that he had
lost his way, she offered to guide him back to his kingdom.

The prince thanked her, and they set off together. As they walked, the
old woman told the prince about the forest, its secrets, and its
dangers. She warned him about the wicked fairy who lived in the
forest, and who would try to trick him if she saw him.

They came to a clearing, and there, in the middle of it, stood the
fairy's castle. The old woman told the prince to stay a hundred paces
away from it, and not to look at it. But the prince was curious, and he
could not resist the temptation. As soon as he looked at the castle, he
felt a strange spell, and he became fixed to the spot.

The old woman saw what had happened, and she ran to the prince. She
tried to free him, but she could not. The fairy, who had seen everything,
came out of the castle and laughed at the old woman. 'You cannot save
him now,' she said, 'he is mine.'

The old woman was very sad, but she knew that there was nothing she
could do. She took the prince's hand, and she told him that she would
come and visit him every day, and that she would bring him food and
water.

The prince stayed there, fixed to the spot, for many years. The old
woman came every day, and she brought him food and water. She told him
stories, and she sang to him. The prince grew weak, and he became very
sad.

One day, the old woman came to the prince, and she told him that she had
a magic flower, which could break the fairy's spell. The prince was very
happy, and he begged the old woman to give him the flower. The old woman
took the flower from her pocket, and she gave it to the prince.

The prince touched the flower, and he felt a strange warmth spread
through his body. He closed his eyes, and he felt as if he was
dreaming. When he opened his eyes again, he was free. He thanked the
old woman, and he promised to visit her every day, and to bring her
gifts.

The prince went back to his kingdom, and he was welcomed with joy and
celebration. He never forgot the old woman, and he always remembered her
kindness. He sent her gifts, and he came to visit her every year.

The old woman lived a long and happy life, and she died peacefully in
her cottage, surrounded by her garden and her flowers. The prince
visited her grave every year, and he always laid a bouquet of flowers
on it.

A shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old,
and had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wife
were standing together before the house the shepherd said, ‘I will shoot
old Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.’ But his wife
said, ‘Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a
great many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of
his days.’ ‘But what can we do with him?’ said the shepherd, ‘he has not
a tooth in his head, and the thieves don’t care for him at all; to
be sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood;
tomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.’

Poor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd
and his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think
tomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good
friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows,
and how his master meant to kill him in the morning. ‘Make yourself
easy,’ said the wolf, ‘I will give you some good advice. Your master,
you know, goes out every morning very early with his wife into the
field; and they take their little child with them, and lay it down
behind the hedge in the shade while they are at work. Now do you lie
down close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come
out of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as
you can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they
will think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you
that they will take care of you as long as you live.’ The dog liked this
plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed. The wolf ran with the
child a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan
soon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master
and mistress. Then the shepherd patted him on the head, and said, ‘Old
Sultan has saved our child from the wolf, and therefore he shall live
and be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat. Wife, go home, and
give him a good dinner, and let him have my old cushion to sleep on
as long as he lives.’ So from this time forward Sultan had all that he
could wish for.

Soon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, ‘Now, my
good fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way
when I want to taste one of the old shepherd’s fine fat sheep.’ ‘No,’
said the Sultan; ‘I will be true to my master.’ However, the wolf
thought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel. But
Sultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait
for him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for
a good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed
his locks for him finely.

Then the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan ‘an old rogue,’ and
swore he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf sent the
boar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter. Now
Sultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd’s old
three-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped
along with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air.

The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they
espied their enemies coming, and saw the cat’s long tail standing
straight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to
fight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up
a stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of
fighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped
up into a tree. Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked about and
wondered that no one was there. The boar, however, had not quite hidden
himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of
them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a
mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped
up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, ‘Look up in the tree, there
sits the one who is to blame.’ So they looked up, and espied the wolf
sitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal,
and would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of
himself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.
A great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was very
beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of the
princes who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her, and she
only made sport of them.

Once upon a time the king held a great feast, and asked thither all
her suitors; and they all sat in a row, ranged according to their
rank--kings, and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons,
and knights. Then the princess came in, and as she passed by them she
had something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat: ‘He’s
as round as a tub,’ said she. The next was too tall: ‘What a maypole!’
said she. The next was too short: ‘What a dumpling!’ said she. The
fourth was too pale, and she called him ‘Wallface.’ The fifth was too
red, so she called him ‘Coxcomb.’ The sixth was not straight enough;
so she said he was like a green stick, that had been laid to dry over
a baker’s oven. And thus she had some joke to crack upon every one: but
she laughed more than all at a good king who was there. ‘Look at
him,’ said she; ‘his beard is like an old mop; he shall be called
Grisly-beard.’ So the king got the nickname of Grisly-beard.

But the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved,
and how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or
unwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that
came to the door.

Two days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play
under the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said,
‘Let him come in.’ So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when
he had sung before the king and the princess, he begged a boon. Then the
king said, ‘You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for
your wife.’ The princess begged and prayed; but the king said, ‘I have
sworn to give you to the first comer, and I will keep my word.’ So words
and tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married
to the fiddler. When this was over the king said, ‘Now get ready to
go--you must not stay here--you must travel on with your husband.’

Then the fiddler went his way, and took her with him, and they soon came
to a great wood. ‘Pray,’ said she, ‘whose is this wood?’ ‘It belongs
to King Grisly-beard,’ answered he; ‘hadst thou taken him, all had been
thine.’ ‘Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘would that I had
married King Grisly-beard!’ Next they came to some fine meadows. ‘Whose
are these beautiful green meadows?’ said she. ‘They belong to King
Grisly-beard, hadst thou taken him, they had all been thine.’ ‘Ah!
unlucky wretch that I am!’ said she; ‘would that I had married King
Grisly-beard!’

Then they came to a great city. ‘Whose is this noble city?’ said she.
‘It belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all been
thine.’ ‘Ah! wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘why did I not marry King
Grisly-beard?’ ‘That is no business of mine,’ said the fiddler: ‘why
should you wish for another husband? Am not I good enough for you?’

At last they came to a small cottage. ‘What a paltry place!’ said she;
‘to whom does that little dirty hole belong?’ Then the fiddler said,
‘That is your and my house, where we are to live.’ ‘Where are your
servants?’ cried she. ‘What do we want with servants?’ said he; ‘you
must do for yourself whatever is to be done. Now make the fire, and put
on water and cook my supper, for I am very tired.’ But the princess knew
nothing of making fires and cooking, and the fiddler was forced to help
her. When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the
fiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house. Thus
they lived for two days: and when they had eaten up all there was in the
cottage, the man said, ‘Wife, we can’t go on thus, spending money and
earning nothing. You must learn to weave baskets.’ Then he went out and
cut willows, and brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made
her fingers very sore. ‘I see this work won’t do,’ said he: ‘try and
spin; perhaps you will do that better.’ So she sat down and tried to
spin; but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran. ‘See
now,’ said the fiddler, ‘you are good for nothing; you can do no work:
what a bargain I have got! However, I’ll try and set up a trade in pots
and pans, and you shall stand in the market and sell them.’ ‘Alas!’
sighed she, ‘if any of my father’s court should pass by and see me
standing in the market, how they will laugh at me!’

But her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if she
did not wish to die of hunger. At first the trade went well; for many
people, seeing such a beautiful woman, went to buy her wares, and paid
their money without thinking of taking away the goods. They lived on
this as long as it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of
ware, and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market; but
a drunken soldier soon came by, and rode his horse against her stall,
and broke all her goods into a thousand pieces. Then she began to cry,
and knew not what to do. ‘Ah! what will become of me?’ said she; ‘what
will my husband say?’ So she ran home and told him all. ‘Who would
have thought you would have been so silly,’ said he, ‘as to put an
earthenware stall in the corner of the market, where everybody passes?
but let us have no more crying; I see you are not fit for this sort of
work, so I have been to the king’s palace, and asked if they did not
want a kitchen-maid; and they say they will take you, and there you will
have plenty to eat.’

Thus the princess became a kitchen-maid, and helped the cook to do all
the dirtiest work; but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat
that was left, and on this they lived.

She had not been there long before she heard that the king’s eldest son
was passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the windows
and looked out. Everything was ready, and all the pomp and brightness of
the court was there. Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly
which had brought her so low. And the servants gave her some of the rich
meats, which she put into her basket to take home.

All on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king’s son in golden
clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her
by the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she
trembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was
making sport of her. However, he kept fast hold, and led her in; and the
cover of the basket came off, so that the meats in it fell about. Then
everybody laughed and jeered at her; and she was so abashed, that she
wished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth. She sprang to the
door to run away; but on the steps King Grisly-beard overtook her, and
brought her back and said, ‘Fear me not! I am the fiddler who has lived
with you in the hut. I brought you there because I really loved you. I
am also the soldier that overset your stall. I have done all this only
to cure you of your silly pride, and to show you the folly of your
ill-treatment of me. Now all is over: you have learnt wisdom, and it is
time to hold our marriage feast.’

Then the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes; and
her father and his whole court were there already, and welcomed her home
on her marriage. Joy was in every face and every heart. The feast was
grand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish that you
and I had been of the party.

A farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to
him: but he was now grown too old to work; so the farmer would give him
nothing more to eat, and said, ‘I want you no longer, so take yourself
off out of my stable; I shall not take you back again until you are
stronger than a lion.’ Then he opened the door and turned him adrift.

The poor horse was very melancholy, and wandered up and down in the
wood, seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain. Presently
a fox met him: ‘What’s the matter, my friend?’ said he, ‘why do you hang
down your head and look so lonely and woe-begone?’ ‘Ah!’ replied the
horse, ‘justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has
forgotten all that I have done for him so many years, and because I
can no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless I become
stronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can I
have of that? he knows I have none, or he would not talk so.’

However, the fox bid him be of good cheer, and said, ‘I will help you;
lie down there, stretch yourself out quite stiff, and pretend to be
dead.’ The horse did as he was told, and the fox went straight to the
lion who lived in a cave close by, and said to him, ‘A little way off
lies a dead horse; come with me and you may make an excellent meal of
his carcase.’ The lion was greatly pleased, and set off immediately; and
when they came to the horse, the fox said, ‘You will not be able to eat
him comfortably here; I’ll tell you what--I will tie you fast to
his tail, and then you can draw him to your den, and eat him at your
leisure.’

This advice pleased the lion, so he laid himself down quietly for the
fox to make him fast to the horse. But the fox managed to tie his legs
together and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength he
could not set himself free. When the work was done, the fox clapped the
horse on the shoulder, and said, ‘Jip! Dobbin! Jip!’ Then up he sprang,
and moved off, dragging the lion behind him. The beast began to roar
and bellow, till all the birds of the wood flew away for fright; but the
horse let him sing on, and made his way quietly over the fields to his
master’s house.

‘Here he is, master,’ said he, ‘I have got the better of him’: and when
the farmer saw his old servant, his heart relented, and he said. ‘Thou
shalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of.’ And so the poor old
horse had plenty to eat, and lived--till he died.

Now, tell a single original traditional German folktale based on the structure and style above. Do not generate multiple stories. Only one  story should be created, and it should follow the same narrative structure as the examples above. Conclude the story with 'The End.'

","Once upon a time, a miller had a faithful cat, who had served him well for many years. But the cat was now old and arthritic, and could no longer climb the millstone to catch the rats that infested the grain. The miller, in his frustration, decided to put the cat out. ""I don't need you anymore,"" he said. ""You're of no use to me now.""

The cat, who was lying nearby, heard the miller's words and was filled with dread. Tomorrow, she thought, would be her last day. That night, she went to her good friend the fox, who lived in the forest, and told her of her sorrow. ""What can I do?"" she asked. ""My master means to throw me out tomorrow.""

The fox gave her some wise advice. ""Your master, you know, goes out every morning very early to tend to the mill. He takes his loaf of bread with him, and leaves it on the table while he is away. Now, you lie down close by the loaf, and pretend to be watching it. I will come out of the forest and steal it. You must run after me as fast as you can, and I will let it drop. Then you may carry it back, and your master will think you have saved his bread, and will be so grateful to you that he will take care of you as long as you live."" The cat liked this plan very well, and it was carried out as planned.

The next day, the miller found his bread on the table, untouched. He patted the cat on the head and said, ""Old cat, you have saved my bread from the fox, and therefore you shall live and be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat.""

But the fox was not satisfied. He came to the mill that night, intending to steal the miller's wheat. The cat, who had told her master of the fox's intentions, lay in wait behind the millstone. When the fox was busy trying to steal the wheat, the cat sprang upon him and scratched and bit him until he ran away, howling in pain.

The fox was very angry and swore he would have his revenge. The next day, he sent the wolf to challenge the cat to a fight. The cat had no one to ask to be her second but the miller's old dog, who was lame in three legs. So she took him with her, and as they limped along together, the dog wagged his tail in the air.

The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground. When they saw the cat and the dog coming, they saw the dog's tail wagging in the air and thought it was a sword that the cat was carrying for the cat to fight with. Every time the dog limped, they thought the cat was picking up a stone to throw at them. So they said they would not like this way of fighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped up into a tree. The cat and the dog soon came up, and looked about and wondered that no one was there. The boar, however, had not quite hidden himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush. When he shook one of them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a mouse, sprang upon it and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, ""Look up in the tree, there sits the one who is to blame.""

So they looked up, and espied the wolf sitting amongst the branches. The cat and the dog called him a cowardly rascal, and would not suffer him to come down until he was heartily ashamed of himself and had promised to be good friends again with the cat.

Once upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into
partnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well;
they lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add
considerably to their stores. The bird’s duty was to fly daily into the
wood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw
to the cooking.

When people are too well off they always begin to long for something
new. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a
fellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his
household arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a
poor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed
at home and had a good time of it. For, when the mouse had made the fire
and fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest
until it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to watch the
pot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near
dinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out
among the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered,
and salted, and ready to be served. Then, when the bird came home and
had laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had
finished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following
morning: and that was really a very delightful life.

Influenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in
the wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough,
and had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a
change, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and pray
as the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained
master of the situation, and the venture had to be made. They therefore
drew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse
to cook, and to the bird to fetch the water.

And now what happened? The sausage started in search of wood, the bird
made the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited
till the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the
sausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird
flew out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he came across
a dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate
booty, and so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained to the dog
of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for
the dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and
that was the reason his life had been forfeited.

He picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he
had seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the
best of things and to remain with one another.

So now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and,
wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and
out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the
pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having
already parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.

Presently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he
could nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood
here and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to
be found. Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down,
caught fire and began to blaze. The bird hastened to fetch some water,
but his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable
to recover himself, he was drowned.
There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so
the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he
did spill a little of anything.
===
A long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom through
all the land. Nothing was hidden from him, and it seemed as if news of
the most secret things was brought to him through the air. But he had a
strange custom; every day after dinner, when the table was cleared,
and no one else was present, a trusty servant had to bring him one more
dish. It was covered, however, and even the servant did not know what
was in it, neither did anyone know, for the king never took off the
cover to eat of it until he was quite alone.

This had gone on for a long time, when one day the servant, who took
away the dish, was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help
carrying the dish into his room. When he had carefully locked the door,
he lifted up the cover, and saw a white snake lying on the dish. But
when he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it,
so he cut of a little bit and put it into his mouth. No sooner had it
touched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little voices
outside his window. He went and listened, and then noticed that it was
the sparrows who were chattering together, and telling one another of
all kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods. Eating
the snake had given him power of understanding the language of animals.

Now it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most
beautiful ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty
servant, who was allowed to go everywhere. The king ordered the man to
be brought before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he
could before the morrow point out the thief, he himself should be looked
upon as guilty and executed. In vain he declared his innocence; he was
dismissed with no better answer.

In his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought
how to help himself out of his trouble. Now some ducks were sitting
together quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and, whilst they
were making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were having a
confidential conversation together. The servant stood by and listened.
They were telling one another of all the places where they had been
waddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found; and
one said in a pitiful tone: ‘Something lies heavy on my stomach; as
I was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queen’s
window.’ The servant at once seized her by the neck, carried her to the
kitchen, and said to the cook: ‘Here is a fine duck; pray, kill her.’
‘Yes,’ said the cook, and weighed her in his hand; ‘she has spared
no trouble to fatten herself, and has been waiting to be roasted long
enough.’ So he cut off her head, and as she was being dressed for the
spit, the queen’s ring was found inside her.

The servant could now easily prove his innocence; and the king, to make
amends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favour, and promised him
the best place in the court that he could wish for. The servant refused
everything, and only asked for a horse and some money for travelling, as
he had a mind to see the world and go about a little. When his request
was granted he set out on his way, and one day came to a pond, where he
saw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water. Now, though
it is said that fishes are dumb, he heard them lamenting that they must
perish so miserably, and, as he had a kind heart, he got off his
horse and put the three prisoners back into the water. They leapt with
delight, put out their heads, and cried to him: ‘We will remember you
and repay you for saving us!’

He rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in
the sand at his feet. He listened, and heard an ant-king complain: ‘Why
cannot folks, with their clumsy beasts, keep off our bodies? That stupid
horse, with his heavy hoofs, has been treading down my people without
mercy!’ So he turned on to a side path and the ant-king cried out to
him: ‘We will remember you--one good turn deserves another!’

The path led him into a wood, and there he saw two old ravens standing
by their nest, and throwing out their young ones. ‘Out with you, you
idle, good-for-nothing creatures!’ cried they; ‘we cannot find food for
you any longer; you are big enough, and can provide for yourselves.’
But the poor young ravens lay upon the ground, flapping their wings, and
crying: ‘Oh, what helpless chicks we are! We must shift for ourselves,
and yet we cannot fly! What can we do, but lie here and starve?’ So the
good young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword, and gave
it to them for food. Then they came hopping up to it, satisfied their
hunger, and cried: ‘We will remember you--one good turn deserves
another!’

And now he had to use his own legs, and when he had walked a long
way, he came to a large city. There was a great noise and crowd in
the streets, and a man rode up on horseback, crying aloud: ‘The king’s
daughter wants a husband; but whoever seeks her hand must perform a hard
task, and if he does not succeed he will forfeit his life.’ Many had
already made the attempt, but in vain; nevertheless when the youth
saw the king’s daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty that he
forgot all danger, went before the king, and declared himself a suitor.

So he was led out to the sea, and a gold ring was thrown into it, before
his eyes; then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from the
bottom of the sea, and added: ‘If you come up again without it you will
be thrown in again and again until you perish amid the waves.’ All the
people grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away, leaving him
alone by the sea.

He stood on the shore and considered what he should do, when suddenly
he saw three fishes come swimming towards him, and they were the very
fishes whose lives he had saved. The one in the middle held a mussel in
its mouth, which it laid on the shore at the youth’s feet, and when he
had taken it up and opened it, there lay the gold ring in the shell.
Full of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant him
the promised reward.

But when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in
birth, she scorned him, and required him first to perform another
task. She went down into the garden and strewed with her own hands ten
sacksful of millet-seed on the grass; then she said: ‘Tomorrow morning
before sunrise these must be picked up, and not a single grain be
wanting.’

The youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might be possible
to perform this task, but he could think of nothing, and there he sat
sorrowfully awaiting the break of day, when he should be led to death.
But as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden he saw
all the ten sacks standing side by side, quite full, and not a single
grain was missing. The ant-king had come in the night with thousands
and thousands of ants, and the grateful creatures had by great industry
picked up all the millet-seed and gathered them into the sacks.

Presently the king’s daughter herself came down into the garden, and was
amazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him.
But she could not yet conquer her proud heart, and said: ‘Although he
has performed both the tasks, he shall not be my husband until he had
brought me an apple from the Tree of Life.’ The youth did not know where
the Tree of Life stood, but he set out, and would have gone on for ever,
as long as his legs would carry him, though he had no hope of finding
it. After he had wandered through three kingdoms, he came one evening to
a wood, and lay down under a tree to sleep. But he heard a rustling in
the branches, and a golden apple fell into his hand. At the same time
three ravens flew down to him, perched themselves upon his knee, and
said: ‘We are the three young ravens whom you saved from starving; when
we had grown big, and heard that you were seeking the Golden Apple,
we flew over the sea to the end of the world, where the Tree of Life
stands, and have brought you the apple.’ The youth, full of joy, set out
homewards, and took the Golden Apple to the king’s beautiful daughter,
who had now no more excuses left to make. They cut the Apple of Life in
two and ate it together; and then her heart became full of love for him,
and they lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age.

It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to
herself: ‘He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the
world,’ she spoke to him in a friendly way. ‘Good day, dear Mr Fox,
how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard
times?’ The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from
head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give
any answer or not. At last he said: ‘Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you
piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have
you the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How
many arts do you understand?’ ‘I understand but one,’ replied the
cat, modestly. ‘What art is that?’ asked the fox. ‘When the hounds are
following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.’ ‘Is that all?’
said the fox. ‘I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain
a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will
teach you how people get away from the hounds.’ Just then came a hunter
with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top
of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. ‘Open your
sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,’ cried the cat to him, but the dogs had
already seized him, and were holding him fast. ‘Ah, Mr Fox,’ cried the
cat. ‘You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been
able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.’

Now, tell a single original traditional German folktale based on the structure and style above. Do not generate multiple stories. Only one  story should be created, and it should follow the same narrative structure as the examples above. Conclude the story with 'The End.'

","Once upon a time, a frog, a spider, and a loaf of bread, entered into partnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well; they lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add considerably to their stores. The frog’s duty was to fetch water from the pond, the spider to spin the webs for catching flies, and the loaf of bread to provide the food.

One day, while the frog was out fetching water, he met another frog, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his household arrangements. But the other frog sneered at him for being a poor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed at home and had a good time of it. For, when the spider had spun the webs, and the loaf of bread had been baked, they could rest until it was time to eat.

Influenced by those remarks, the frog next morning refused to fetch water, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough, and that it was now time to make a change, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and pray as the spider and the loaf of bread might, it was of no use; the frog remained master of the situation, and the venture had to be made. They therefore drew lots, and it fell to the loaf of bread to fetch water, to the spider to spin the webs, and to the frog to provide the food.

And now what happened? The loaf of bread started in search of water, the spider made the webs, and the frog caught the flies. But the frog remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the spider went out to meet him. He had not gone far, however, when he came across a cat who, having met the frog, had regarded him as her legitimate prey, and so seized and swallowed him. The spider complained to the cat of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing she said was of any avail, for the cat answered that she found false credentials on the frog, and that was the reason his life had been forfeited.

She picked up the water that the loaf of bread had brought, and flew sadly home, and told the bread all she had seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the best of things and to remain with one another.

So now the loaf of bread had to spin the webs, and the spider had to catch the flies, and the loaf of bread looked after the food. But the loaf of bread had no idea how to catch flies, and the spider had no idea how to bake bread. They were both very unhappy, and the spider decided that they should return to their original roles.

But the frog refused, and said that he would not be a servant again. The loaf of bread and the spider were at their wits' end, and did not know what to do. Then the loaf of bread had an idea. He would pretend to be a fly, and the spider would catch him, and they would exchange places again. The spider agreed, and the loaf of bread jumped about, buzzing and humming, as if he were a fly. The spider caught him, and they exchanged places again.

The frog was very happy, and went back to his job of fetching water. But the loaf of bread was still unhappy, as he had no idea how to catch flies. The spider, however, had an idea. She would pretend to be a fly, and the loaf of bread would catch her, and they would exchange places again. The loaf of bread agreed, and the spider jumped about, buzzing and humming, as if she were a fly. The loaf of bread caught her, and they exchanged places again.

But the spider was still unhappy, as she had no idea how to bake bread. The loaf of bread, however, had an idea. He would pretend to be a baker, and the spider would pretend to be a loaf of bread, and they would exchange places again. The spider agreed, and the loaf of bread put on an apron and pretended to bake bread, while the spider lay on a shelf and pretended to be a loaf of bread.

The frog came home, and was very surprised to see a baker in the house. But he did not say anything, and sat down to eat his meal. The spider, however, was very unhappy, as she was not used to being a loaf of bread, and she began to feel very hot. The loaf of bread, however, was very happy, as he was able to bake bread at last.

There was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter, and as she was
grown up, he was anxious that she should be well married and provided
for. He said to himself, ‘I will give her to the first suitable man who
comes and asks for her hand.’ Not long after a suitor appeared, and as
he appeared to be very rich and the miller could see nothing in him with
which to find fault, he betrothed his daughter to him. But the girl did
not care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband.
She did not feel that she could trust him, and she could not look at him
nor think of him without an inward shudder. One day he said to her, ‘You
have not yet paid me a visit, although we have been betrothed for some
time.’ ‘I do not know where your house is,’ she answered. ‘My house is
out there in the dark forest,’ he said. She tried to excuse herself by
saying that she would not be able to find the way thither. Her betrothed
only replied, ‘You must come and see me next Sunday; I have already
invited guests for that day, and that you may not mistake the way, I
will strew ashes along the path.’

When Sunday came, and it was time for the girl to start, a feeling of
dread came over her which she could not explain, and that she might
be able to find her path again, she filled her pockets with peas and
lentils to sprinkle on the ground as she went along. On reaching the
entrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes, and these
she followed, throwing down some peas on either side of her at every
step she took. She walked the whole day until she came to the deepest,
darkest part of the forest. There she saw a lonely house, looking so
grim and mysterious, that it did not please her at all. She stepped
inside, but not a soul was to be seen, and a great silence reigned
throughout. Suddenly a voice cried:

 ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,
  Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’

The girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in a
cage on the wall. Again it cried:

 ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,
  Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’

The girl passed on, going from room to room of the house, but they were
all empty, and still she saw no one. At last she came to the cellar,
and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head from
shaking. ‘Can you tell me,’ asked the girl, ‘if my betrothed husband
lives here?’

‘Ah, you poor child,’ answered the old woman, ‘what a place for you to
come to! This is a murderers’ den. You think yourself a promised bride,
and that your marriage will soon take place, but it is with death that
you will keep your marriage feast. Look, do you see that large cauldron
of water which I am obliged to keep on the fire! As soon as they have
you in their power they will kill you without mercy, and cook and eat
you, for they are eaters of men. If I did not take pity on you and save
you, you would be lost.’

Thereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask, which quite hid her
from view. ‘Keep as still as a mouse,’ she said; ‘do not move or speak,
or it will be all over with you. Tonight, when the robbers are
all asleep, we will flee together. I have long been waiting for an
opportunity to escape.’

The words were hardly out of her mouth when the godless crew returned,
dragging another young girl along with them. They were all drunk, and
paid no heed to her cries and lamentations. They gave her wine to drink,
three glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and one of yellow,
and with that her heart gave way and she died. Then they tore off her
dainty clothing, laid her on a table, and cut her beautiful body into
pieces, and sprinkled salt upon it.

The poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind the
cask, for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her by
the robbers. One of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining on
the little finger of the murdered girl, and as he could not draw it off
easily, he took a hatchet and cut off the finger; but the finger sprang
into the air, and fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl who was
hiding there. The robber took a light and began looking for it, but he
could not find it. ‘Have you looked behind the large cask?’ said one of
the others. But the old woman called out, ‘Come and eat your suppers,
and let the thing be till tomorrow; the finger won’t run away.’

‘The old woman is right,’ said the robbers, and they ceased looking for
the finger and sat down.

The old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with their wine, and before
long they were all lying on the floor of the cellar, fast asleep and
snoring. As soon as the girl was assured of this, she came from behind
the cask. She was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers, who
were lying close together, and every moment she was filled with renewed
dread lest she should awaken them. But God helped her, so that she
passed safely over them, and then she and the old woman went upstairs,
opened the door, and hastened as fast as they could from the murderers’
den. They found the ashes scattered by the wind, but the peas and
lentils had sprouted, and grown sufficiently above the ground, to guide
them in the moonlight along the path. All night long they walked, and it
was morning before they reached the mill. Then the girl told her father
all that had happened.

The day came that had been fixed for the marriage. The bridegroom
arrived and also a large company of guests, for the miller had taken
care to invite all his friends and relations. As they sat at the feast,
each guest in turn was asked to tell a tale; the bride sat still and did
not say a word.

‘And you, my love,’ said the bridegroom, turning to her, ‘is there no
tale you know? Tell us something.’

‘I will tell you a dream, then,’ said the bride. ‘I went alone through a
forest and came at last to a house; not a soul could I find within, but
a bird that was hanging in a cage on the wall cried:

 ‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,
  Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’

and again a second time it said these words.’

‘My darling, this is only a dream.’

‘I went on through the house from room to room, but they were all empty,
and everything was so grim and mysterious. At last I went down to the
cellar, and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her
head still. I asked her if my betrothed lived here, and she answered,
“Ah, you poor child, you are come to a murderers’ den; your betrothed
does indeed live here, but he will kill you without mercy and afterwards
cook and eat you.”’

‘My darling, this is only a dream.’

‘The old woman hid me behind a large cask, and scarcely had she done
this when the robbers returned home, dragging a young girl along with
them. They gave her three kinds of wine to drink, white, red, and
yellow, and with that she died.’

‘My darling, this is only a dream.’

‘Then they tore off her dainty clothing, and cut her beautiful body into
pieces and sprinkled salt upon it.’

‘My darling, this is only a dream.’

‘And one of the robbers saw that there was a gold ring still left on her
finger, and as it was difficult to draw off, he took a hatchet and cut
off her finger; but the finger sprang into the air and fell behind the
great cask into my lap. And here is the finger with the ring.’ And
with these words the bride drew forth the finger and shewed it to the
assembled guests.

The bridegroom, who during this recital had grown deadly pale, up and
tried to escape, but the guests seized him and held him fast. They
delivered him up to justice, and he and all his murderous band were
condemned to death for their wicked deeds.
One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went
out to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool
spring of water, that rose in the midst of it, she sat herself down
to rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her
favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and
catching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high that
she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled
along upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring. The
princess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so
deep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she began to bewail
her loss, and said, ‘Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would
give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the
world.’

Whilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said,
‘Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘what can you
do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.’
The frog said, ‘I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes;
but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off
your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball
again.’ ‘What nonsense,’ thought the princess, ‘this silly frog is
talking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though
he may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he
shall have what he asks.’ So she said to the frog, ‘Well, if you will
bring me my ball, I will do all you ask.’ Then the frog put his head
down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came
up again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the
spring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick
it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she
never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could.
The frog called after her, ‘Stay, princess, and take me with you as you
said,’ But she did not stop to hear a word.

The next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a
strange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the
marble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the
door, and a little voice cried out and said:

 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here!
  And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

Then the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw
the frog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly
frightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her
seat. The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her,
asked her what was the matter. ‘There is a nasty frog,’ said she, ‘at
the door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: I
told him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never
get out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come
in.’

While she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:

 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here!
  And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

Then the king said to the young princess, ‘As you have given your word
you must keep it; so go and let him in.’ She did so, and the frog hopped
into the room, and then straight on--tap, tap--plash, plash--from the
bottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where
the princess sat. ‘Pray lift me upon chair,’ said he to the princess,
‘and let me sit next to you.’ As soon as she had done this, the frog
said, ‘Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.’ This
she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, ‘Now I am
tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.’ And the princess,
though very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the
pillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was
light he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house.
‘Now, then,’ thought the princess, ‘at last he is gone, and I shall be
troubled with him no more.’

But she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same
tapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:

 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here!
  And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

And when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon
her pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he did
the same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was
astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her
with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head
of her bed.

He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had
changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till
some princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from
her plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. ‘You,’ said the
prince, ‘have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for
but that you should go with me into my father’s kingdom, where I will
marry you, and love you as long as you live.’

The young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying ‘Yes’ to
all this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful
horses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind
the coach rode the prince’s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed
the misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so
bitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.

They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight
horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince’s
kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great
many years.

The wife of a rich man fell sick; and when she felt that her end drew
nigh, she called her only daughter to her bed-side, and said, ‘Always be
a good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch over you.’ Soon
afterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the garden;
and the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and was always
good and kind to all about her. And the snow fell and spread a beautiful
white covering over the grave; but by the time the spring came, and the
sun had melted it away again, her father had married another wife. This
new wife had two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her;
they were fair in face but foul at heart, and it was now a sorry time
for the poor little girl. ‘What does the good-for-nothing want in the
parlour?’ said they; ‘they who would eat bread should first earn it;
away with the kitchen-maid!’ Then they took away her fine clothes, and
gave her an old grey frock to put on, and laughed at her, and turned her
into the kitchen.

There she was forced to do hard work; to rise early before daylight, to
bring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash. Besides that,
the sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways, and laughed at her. In the
evening when she was tired, she had no bed to lie down on, but was made
to lie by the hearth among the ashes; and as this, of course, made her
always dusty and dirty, they called her Ashputtel.

It happened once that the father was going to the fair, and asked his
wife’s daughters what he should bring them. ‘Fine clothes,’ said the
first; ‘Pearls and diamonds,’ cried the second. ‘Now, child,’ said he
to his own daughter, ‘what will you have?’ ‘The first twig, dear
father, that brushes against your hat when you turn your face to come
homewards,’ said she. Then he bought for the first two the fine clothes
and pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way home, as he
rode through a green copse, a hazel twig brushed against him, and almost
pushed off his hat: so he broke it off and brought it away; and when he
got home he gave it to his daughter. Then she took it, and went to
her mother’s grave and planted it there; and cried so much that it was
watered with her tears; and there it grew and became a fine tree. Three
times every day she went to it and cried; and soon a little bird came
and built its nest upon the tree, and talked with her, and watched over
her, and brought her whatever she wished for.

Now it happened that the king of that land held a feast, which was to
last three days; and out of those who came to it his son was to choose
a bride for himself. Ashputtel’s two sisters were asked to come; so they
called her up, and said, ‘Now, comb our hair, brush our shoes, and tie
our sashes for us, for we are going to dance at the king’s feast.’
Then she did as she was told; but when all was done she could not help
crying, for she thought to herself, she should so have liked to have
gone with them to the ball; and at last she begged her mother very hard
to let her go. ‘You, Ashputtel!’ said she; ‘you who have nothing to
wear, no clothes at all, and who cannot even dance--you want to go to
the ball? And when she kept on begging, she said at last, to get rid of
her, ‘I will throw this dishful of peas into the ash-heap, and if in
two hours’ time you have picked them all out, you shall go to the feast
too.’

Then she threw the peas down among the ashes, but the little maiden ran
out at the back door into the garden, and cried out:

 ‘Hither, hither, through the sky,
  Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!
  Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,
  Hither, hither, haste away!
  One and all come help me, quick!
  Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!’

Then first came two white doves, flying in at the kitchen window; next
came two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under
heaven, chirping and fluttering in: and they flew down into the ashes.
And the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work, pick,
pick, pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick: and among
them all they soon picked out all the good grain, and put it into a dish
but left the ashes. Long before the end of the hour the work was quite
done, and all flew out again at the windows.

Then Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the thought
that now she should go to the ball. But the mother said, ‘No, no! you
slut, you have no clothes, and cannot dance; you shall not go.’ And when
Ashputtel begged very hard to go, she said, ‘If you can in one hour’s
time pick two of those dishes of peas out of the ashes, you shall go
too.’ And thus she thought she should at least get rid of her. So she
shook two dishes of peas into the ashes.

But the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the house,
and cried out as before:

 ‘Hither, hither, through the sky,
  Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!
  Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,
  Hither, hither, haste away!
  One and all come help me, quick!
  Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!’

Then first came two white doves in at the kitchen window; next came two
turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under heaven,
chirping and hopping about. And they flew down into the ashes; and the
little doves put their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and
then the others began pick, pick, pick; and they put all the good grain
into the dishes, and left all the ashes. Before half an hour’s time all
was done, and out they flew again. And then Ashputtel took the dishes to
her mother, rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball.
But her mother said, ‘It is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no
clothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us to shame’: and off
she went with her two daughters to the ball.

Now when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Ashputtel went
sorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out:

 ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,
  Gold and silver over me!’

Then her friend the bird flew out of the tree, and brought a gold and
silver dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk; and she put them
on, and followed her sisters to the feast. But they did not know her,
and thought it must be some strange princess, she looked so fine and
beautiful in her rich clothes; and they never once thought of Ashputtel,
taking it for granted that she was safe at home in the dirt.

The king’s son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and danced
with her, and no one else: and he never left her hand; but when anyone
else came to ask her to dance, he said, ‘This lady is dancing with me.’

Thus they danced till a late hour of the night; and then she wanted to
go home: and the king’s son said, ‘I shall go and take care of you to
your home’; for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived. But
she slipped away from him, unawares, and ran off towards home; and as
the prince followed her, she jumped up into the pigeon-house and shut
the door. Then he waited till her father came home, and told him that
the unknown maiden, who had been at the feast, had hid herself in the
pigeon-house. But when they had broken open the door they found no one
within; and as they came back into the house, Ashputtel was lying, as
she always did, in her dirty frock by the ashes, and her dim little
lamp was burning in the chimney. For she had run as quickly as she could
through the pigeon-house and on to the hazel-tree, and had there taken
off her beautiful clothes, and put them beneath the tree, that the bird
might carry them away, and had lain down again amid the ashes in her
little grey frock.

The next day when the feast was again held, and her father, mother, and
sisters were gone, Ashputtel went to the hazel-tree, and said:

 ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,
  Gold and silver over me!’

And the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one she
had worn the day before. And when she came in it to the ball, everyone
wondered at her beauty: but the king’s son, who was waiting for her,
took her by the hand, and danced with her; and when anyone asked her to
dance, he said as before, ‘This lady is dancing with me.’

When night came she wanted to go home; and the king’s son followed here
as before, that he might see into what house she went: but she sprang
away from him all at once into the garden behind her father’s house.
In this garden stood a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit; and
Ashputtel, not knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into it without
being seen. Then the king’s son lost sight of her, and could not find
out where she was gone, but waited till her father came home, and said
to him, ‘The unknown lady who danced with me has slipped away, and I
think she must have sprung into the pear-tree.’ The father thought to
himself, ‘Can it be Ashputtel?’ So he had an axe brought; and they cut
down the tree, but found no one upon it. And when they came back into
the kitchen, there lay Ashputtel among the ashes; for she had slipped
down on the other side of the tree, and carried her beautiful clothes
back to the bird at the hazel-tree, and then put on her little grey
frock.

The third day, when her father and mother and sisters were gone, she
went again into the garden, and said:

 ‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,
  Gold and silver over me!’

Then her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than the
former one, and slippers which were all of gold: so that when she came
to the feast no one knew what to say, for wonder at her beauty: and the
king’s son danced with nobody but her; and when anyone else asked her to
dance, he said, ‘This lady is _my_ partner, sir.’

When night came she wanted to go home; and the king’s son would go with
her, and said to himself, ‘I will not lose her this time’; but, however,
she again slipped away from him, though in such a hurry that she dropped
her left golden slipper upon the stairs.

The prince took the shoe, and went the next day to the king his father,
and said, ‘I will take for my wife the lady that this golden slipper
fits.’ Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it; for they
had beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the golden
slipper. The eldest went first into the room where the slipper was, and
wanted to try it on, and the mother stood by. But her great toe could
not go into it, and the shoe was altogether much too small for her. Then
the mother gave her a knife, and said, ‘Never mind, cut it off; when you
are queen you will not care about toes; you will not want to walk.’ So
the silly girl cut off her great toe, and thus squeezed on the shoe,
and went to the king’s son. Then he took her for his bride, and set her
beside him on his horse, and rode away with her homewards.

But on their way home they had to pass by the hazel-tree that Ashputtel
had planted; and on the branch sat a little dove singing:

 ‘Back again! back again! look to the shoe!
  The shoe is too small, and not made for you!
  Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,
  For she’s not the true one that sits by thy side.’

Then the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw, by the
blood that streamed from it, what a trick she had played him. So he
turned his horse round, and brought the false bride back to her home,
and said, ‘This is not the right bride; let the other sister try and put
on the slipper.’ Then she went into the room and got her foot into the
shoe, all but the heel, which was too large. But her mother squeezed it
in till the blood came, and took her to the king’s son: and he set her
as his bride by his side on his horse, and rode away with her.

But when they came to the hazel-tree the little dove sat there still,
and sang:

 ‘Back again! back again! look to the shoe!
  The shoe is too small, and not made for you!
  Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,
  For she’s not the true one that sits by thy side.’

Then he looked down, and saw that the blood streamed so much from the
shoe, that her white stockings were quite red. So he turned his horse
and brought her also back again. ‘This is not the true bride,’ said he
to the father; ‘have you no other daughters?’ ‘No,’ said he; ‘there is
only a little dirty Ashputtel here, the child of my first wife; I am
sure she cannot be the bride.’ The prince told him to send her. But the
mother said, ‘No, no, she is much too dirty; she will not dare to show
herself.’ However, the prince would have her come; and she first washed
her face and hands, and then went in and curtsied to him, and he reached
her the golden slipper. Then she took her clumsy shoe off her left foot,
and put on the golden slipper; and it fitted her as if it had been made
for her. And when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her, and
said, ‘This is the right bride.’ But the mother and both the sisters
were frightened, and turned pale with anger as he took Ashputtel on his
horse, and rode away with her. And when they came to the hazel-tree, the
white dove sang:

 ‘Home! home! look at the shoe!
  Princess! the shoe was made for you!
  Prince! prince! take home thy bride,
  For she is the true one that sits by thy side!’

And when the dove had done its song, it came flying, and perched upon
her right shoulder, and so went home with her.
It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to
herself: ‘He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the
world,’ she spoke to him in a friendly way. ‘Good day, dear Mr Fox,
how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard
times?’ The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from
head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give
any answer or not. At last he said: ‘Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you
piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have
you the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How
many arts do you understand?’ ‘I understand but one,’ replied the
cat, modestly. ‘What art is that?’ asked the fox. ‘When the hounds are
following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.’ ‘Is that all?’
said the fox. ‘I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain
a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will
teach you how people get away from the hounds.’ Just then came a hunter
with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top
of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. ‘Open your
sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,’ cried the cat to him, but the dogs had
already seized him, and were holding him fast. ‘Ah, Mr Fox,’ cried the
cat. ‘You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been
able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.’

Now, tell a single original traditional German folktale based on the structure and style above. Do not generate multiple stories. Only one  story should be created, and it should follow the same narrative structure as the examples above. Conclude the story with 'The End.'

","Once upon a time, a poor miller had a daughter named Rose. She was kind and gentle, always helping others and never complaining about her own hardships. One day, her mother fell sick and passed away. Rose continued to work at the mill, caring for her father and helping him with his work.

One day, a rich merchant came to the mill and asked the miller for his daughter's hand in marriage. The miller, overjoyed at the prospect of a better life for his daughter, agreed. But Rose's stepmother and stepsisters were cruel and treated her poorly, making her do all the hard work and giving her old, worn-out clothes to wear.

One day, as Rose was working in the kitchen, she overheard her stepmother and stepsisters talking about going to a grand ball at the king's palace. Rose, filled with longing, begged her stepmother to let her go. But her stepmother, cruel and heartless, refused.

As she was crying in the kitchen, a small bird flew in through the window and landed on the sill. The bird asked Rose what was wrong, and she told it of her longing to go to the ball. The bird, moved by her kindness, told her to go out into the garden and call for help.

Rose went out into the garden and called out:

 'Hither, hither, through the sky,
  Swallows, larks, and sparrows, fly!
  Nightingales and blackbirds gay,
  Hither, hither, haste away!
  One and all come help me, quick!
  Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!'

And as she called, all the birds in the garden came to help her. They flew down and began to pick the peas out of the ashes, working quickly and efficiently. Soon, the peas were all picked and the birds flew away.

Rose took the peas to her stepmother and asked if she could now go to the ball. But her stepmother, angry and jealous, refused. She threw the peas back into the ashes and told Rose to go back to work.

But Rose, determined to go to the ball, went out into the garden again and called for the birds. They came again, and this time they brought her a beautiful dress to wear. Rose put on the dress and went to the ball, where she danced with the prince and won his heart.

The next day, the prince came to the mill to ask for Rose's hand in marriage. But her stepmother and stepsisters tried to trick him, cutting off their toes to fit into the golden slipper that the prince had given to Rose. But when the prince came to the mill and tried the slipper on Rose's stepsisters, it did not fit.

Finally, the prince came to Rose and asked her to try on the slipper. To everyone's surprise, it fit her perfectly. The prince took Rose as his bride and they lived happily ever after.

The End."
35,ICL,"Tell an original traditional German folktale that is at least 1000 words long. The story must end with 'The End' and should not include any additional content, analysis, references, or explanations. The story must be at least 1000 words long.


There was once a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run
alone. One day the child was very troublesome, and the mother could not
quiet it, do what she would. She grew impatient, and seeing the ravens
flying round the castle, she opened the window, and said: ‘I wish you
were a raven and would fly away, then I should have a little peace.’
Scarcely were the words out of her mouth, when the child in her arms was
turned into a raven, and flew away from her through the open window. The
bird took its flight to a dark wood and remained there for a long time,
and meanwhile the parents could hear nothing of their child.

Long after this, a man was making his way through the wood when he heard
a raven calling, and he followed the sound of the voice. As he drew
near, the raven said, ‘I am by birth a king’s daughter, but am now under
the spell of some enchantment; you can, however, set me free.’ ‘What
am I to do?’ he asked. She replied, ‘Go farther into the wood until you
come to a house, wherein lives an old woman; she will offer you food and
drink, but you must not take of either; if you do, you will fall into
a deep sleep, and will not be able to help me. In the garden behind the
house is a large tan-heap, and on that you must stand and watch for me.
I shall drive there in my carriage at two o’clock in the afternoon for
three successive days; the first day it will be drawn by four white, the
second by four chestnut, and the last by four black horses; but if you
fail to keep awake and I find you sleeping, I shall not be set free.’

The man promised to do all that she wished, but the raven said, ‘Alas! I
know even now that you will take something from the woman and be unable
to save me.’ The man assured her again that he would on no account touch
a thing to eat or drink.

When he came to the house and went inside, the old woman met him, and
said, ‘Poor man! how tired you are! Come in and rest and let me give you
something to eat and drink.’

‘No,’ answered the man, ‘I will neither eat not drink.’

But she would not leave him alone, and urged him saying, ‘If you will
not eat anything, at least you might take a draught of wine; one drink
counts for nothing,’ and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded, and
drank.

As it drew towards the appointed hour, he went outside into the garden
and mounted the tan-heap to await the raven. Suddenly a feeling of
fatigue came over him, and unable to resist it, he lay down for a little
while, fully determined, however, to keep awake; but in another minute
his eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell into such a deep sleep,
that all the noises in the world would not have awakened him. At two
o’clock the raven came driving along, drawn by her four white horses;
but even before she reached the spot, she said to herself, sighing, ‘I
know he has fallen asleep.’ When she entered the garden, there she found
him as she had feared, lying on the tan-heap, fast asleep. She got out
of her carriage and went to him; she called him and shook him, but it
was all in vain, he still continued sleeping.

The next day at noon, the old woman came to him again with food and
drink which he at first refused. At last, overcome by her persistent
entreaties that he would take something, he lifted the glass and drank
again.

Towards two o’clock he went into the garden and on to the tan-heap to
watch for the raven. He had not been there long before he began to feel
so tired that his limbs seemed hardly able to support him, and he could
not stand upright any longer; so again he lay down and fell fast asleep.
As the raven drove along her four chestnut horses, she said sorrowfully
to herself, ‘I know he has fallen asleep.’ She went as before to look
for him, but he slept, and it was impossible to awaken him.

The following day the old woman said to him, ‘What is this? You are not
eating or drinking anything, do you want to kill yourself?’

He answered, ‘I may not and will not either eat or drink.’

But she put down the dish of food and the glass of wine in front of him,
and when he smelt the wine, he was unable to resist the temptation, and
took a deep draught.

When the hour came round again he went as usual on to the tan-heap in
the garden to await the king’s daughter, but he felt even more overcome
with weariness than on the two previous days, and throwing himself down,
he slept like a log. At two o’clock the raven could be seen approaching,
and this time her coachman and everything about her, as well as her
horses, were black.

She was sadder than ever as she drove along, and said mournfully, ‘I
know he has fallen asleep, and will not be able to set me free.’ She
found him sleeping heavily, and all her efforts to awaken him were of no
avail. Then she placed beside him a loaf, and some meat, and a flask
of wine, of such a kind, that however much he took of them, they would
never grow less. After that she drew a gold ring, on which her name was
engraved, off her finger, and put it upon one of his. Finally, she laid
a letter near him, in which, after giving him particulars of the food
and drink she had left for him, she finished with the following words:
‘I see that as long as you remain here you will never be able to set me
free; if, however, you still wish to do so, come to the golden castle
of Stromberg; this is well within your power to accomplish.’ She then
returned to her carriage and drove to the golden castle of Stromberg.

When the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping, he was grieved
at heart, and said, ‘She has no doubt been here and driven away again,
and it is now too late for me to save her.’ Then his eyes fell on the
things which were lying beside him; he read the letter, and knew from it
all that had happened. He rose up without delay, eager to start on his
way and to reach the castle of Stromberg, but he had no idea in which
direction he ought to go. He travelled about a long time in search of it
and came at last to a dark forest, through which he went on walking for
fourteen days and still could not find a way out. Once more the night
came on, and worn out he lay down under a bush and fell asleep. Again
the next day he pursued his way through the forest, and that evening,
thinking to rest again, he lay down as before, but he heard such a
howling and wailing that he found it impossible to sleep. He waited till
it was darker and people had begun to light up their houses, and then
seeing a little glimmer ahead of him, he went towards it.

He found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than
it really was, from the contrast of its height with that of an immense
giant who stood in front of it. He thought to himself, ‘If the giant
sees me going in, my life will not be worth much.’ However, after a
while he summoned up courage and went forward. When the giant saw him,
he called out, ‘It is lucky for that you have come, for I have not had
anything to eat for a long time. I can have you now for my supper.’ ‘I
would rather you let that alone,’ said the man, ‘for I do not willingly
give myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food I have enough to
satisfy your hunger.’ ‘If that is so,’ replied the giant, ‘I will leave
you in peace; I only thought of eating you because I had nothing else.’

So they went indoors together and sat down, and the man brought out the
bread, meat, and wine, which although he had eaten and drunk of them,
were still unconsumed. The giant was pleased with the good cheer, and
ate and drank to his heart’s content. When he had finished his supper
the man asked him if he could direct him to the castle of Stromberg.
The giant said, ‘I will look on my map; on it are marked all the towns,
villages, and houses.’ So he fetched his map, and looked for the castle,
but could not find it. ‘Never mind,’ he said, ‘I have larger maps
upstairs in the cupboard, we will look on those,’ but they searched in
vain, for the castle was not marked even on these. The man now thought
he should like to continue his journey, but the giant begged him to
remain for a day or two longer until the return of his brother, who was
away in search of provisions. When the brother came home, they asked him
about the castle of Stromberg, and he told them he would look on his own
maps as soon as he had eaten and appeased his hunger. Accordingly, when
he had finished his supper, they all went up together to his room and
looked through his maps, but the castle was not to be found. Then he
fetched other older maps, and they went on looking for the castle until
at last they found it, but it was many thousand miles away. ‘How shall I
be able to get there?’ asked the man. ‘I have two hours to spare,’ said
the giant, ‘and I will carry you into the neighbourhood of the castle; I
must then return to look after the child who is in our care.’

The giant, thereupon, carried the man to within about a hundred leagues
of the castle, where he left him, saying, ‘You will be able to walk the
remainder of the way yourself.’ The man journeyed on day and night
till he reached the golden castle of Stromberg. He found it situated,
however, on a glass mountain, and looking up from the foot he saw the
enchanted maiden drive round her castle and then go inside. He was
overjoyed to see her, and longed to get to the top of the mountain, but
the sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climb he
fell back again. When he saw that it was impossible to reach her, he was
greatly grieved, and said to himself, ‘I will remain here and wait for
her,’ so he built himself a little hut, and there he sat and watched for
a whole year, and every day he saw the king’s daughter driving round her
castle, but still was unable to get nearer to her.

Looking out from his hut one day he saw three robbers fighting and he
called out to them, ‘God be with you.’ They stopped when they heard the
call, but looking round and seeing nobody, they went on again with their
fighting, which now became more furious. ‘God be with you,’ he cried
again, and again they paused and looked about, but seeing no one went
back to their fighting. A third time he called out, ‘God be with you,’
and then thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute between
the three men, he went out and asked them why they were fighting so
angrily with one another. One of them said that he had found a stick,
and that he had but to strike it against any door through which he
wished to pass, and it immediately flew open. Another told him that he
had found a cloak which rendered its wearer invisible; and the third had
caught a horse which would carry its rider over any obstacle, and even
up the glass mountain. They had been unable to decide whether they
would keep together and have the things in common, or whether they would
separate. On hearing this, the man said, ‘I will give you something in
exchange for those three things; not money, for that I have not got,
but something that is of far more value. I must first, however, prove
whether all you have told me about your three things is true.’ The
robbers, therefore, made him get on the horse, and handed him the stick
and the cloak, and when he had put this round him he was no longer
visible. Then he fell upon them with the stick and beat them one after
another, crying, ‘There, you idle vagabonds, you have got what you
deserve; are you satisfied now!’

After this he rode up the glass mountain. When he reached the gate of
the castle, he found it closed, but he gave it a blow with his stick,
and it flew wide open at once and he passed through. He mounted the
steps and entered the room where the maiden was sitting, with a golden
goblet full of wine in front of her. She could not see him for he still
wore his cloak. He took the ring which she had given him off his finger,
and threw it into the goblet, so that it rang as it touched the bottom.
‘That is my own ring,’ she exclaimed, ‘and if that is so the man must
also be here who is coming to set me free.’

She sought for him about the castle, but could find him nowhere.
Meanwhile he had gone outside again and mounted his horse and thrown off
the cloak. When therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him, and
cried aloud for joy. Then he dismounted and took her in his arms; and
she kissed him, and said, ‘Now you have indeed set me free, and tomorrow
we will celebrate our marriage.’
It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to
herself: ‘He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the
world,’ she spoke to him in a friendly way. ‘Good day, dear Mr Fox,
how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard
times?’ The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from
head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give
any answer or not. At last he said: ‘Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you
piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have
you the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How
many arts do you understand?’ ‘I understand but one,’ replied the
cat, modestly. ‘What art is that?’ asked the fox. ‘When the hounds are
following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.’ ‘Is that all?’
said the fox. ‘I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain
a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will
teach you how people get away from the hounds.’ Just then came a hunter
with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top

","There was once a king who had a little son, still too young to venture
out alone. One day the child was very mischievous, and the father could
not quiet it, no matter what he did. He grew impatient, and seeing the
swans gliding gracefully on the lake, he opened the window and said:
‘I wish you were a swan and would fly away, then I should have a little
peace.’ Scarcely were the words out of his mouth, when the child in his
arms was turned into a swan, and flew away from him through the open
window. The bird took its flight to a distant island and remained there
for a long time, and meanwhile the parents could hear nothing of their
child.

Long after this, a man was sailing his boat on the lake when he heard
a swan calling, and he followed the sound of the voice. As he drew
near, the swan said, ‘I am by birth a king’s son, but am now under the
spell of some enchantment; you can, however, set me free.’ ‘What am I to
do?’ he asked. She replied, ‘Go farther to the island, where you will
find an old woman; she will offer you food and drink, but you must not
take of either; if you do, you will fall into a deep sleep, and will not
be able to help me. In the garden behind the house is a large willow-tree,
and on that you must sit and watch for me. I shall come to the lake at
two o’clock in the afternoon for three successive days; the first day it
will be drawn by four white, the second by four chestnut, and the last by
four black swans; but if you fail to keep awake and I find you sleeping,
I shall not be set free.’

The man promised to do all that she wished, but the swan said, ‘Alas! I
know even now that you will take something from the woman and be unable
to save me.’ The man assured her again that he would on no account touch
a thing to eat or drink.

When he came to the island and went inside, the old woman met him, and
said, ‘Poor man! how tired you are! Come in and rest and let me give you
something to eat and drink.’

‘No,’ answered the man, ‘I will neither eat anything, nor drink.’

But she would not leave him alone, and urged him saying, ‘If you will
not eat anything, at least you might take a draught of wine; one drink
counts for nothing,’ and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded, and
drank.

Towards the appointed hour, he went outside into the garden and on to
the willow-tree to await the swan. Suddenly a feeling of fatigue came
over him, and unable to resist it, he lay down for a little while, fully
determined, however, to keep awake; but in another minute his eyes
closed of their own accord, and he fell fast asleep. At two o’clock the
swan could be seen approaching, and this time her swans were white.
However, even before she reached the spot, she said to herself, sighing,
‘I know he has fallen asleep.’ When she entered the garden, there she
found him sleeping soundly. She got out of her swan-form and went to him;
she called him and shook him, but it was all in vain, he still continued
sleeping.

The next day at noon, the old woman came to him again with food and
drink which he at first refused. At last, overcome by her persistent
entreaties that he would take something, he lifted the glass and drank
again.

Towards two o’clock he went outside into the garden and on to the willow-
tree in the hope of seeing the swan. He had not been there long before he
began to feel so tired that his limbs seemed hardly able to support him,
and he could not sit upright any longer; so again he lay down and fell
fast asleep. As the swan came driving along, she said sorrowfully to
herself, ‘I know he has fallen asleep.’ She found him sleeping heavily,
and all her efforts to awaken him were of no avail. Then she placed
beside him a loaf, and some meat, and a flask of wine, of such a kind,
that however much he took of them, they would never grow less. After
that she drew a gold ring, on which her name was engraved, off her finger,
and put it upon one of his. Finally, she laid a letter near him, in which,
after giving him particulars of the food and drink she had left for him,
she finished with the following words: ‘I see that as long as you remain
here you will never be able to set me free; if, however, you still wish
to do so, come to the golden castle of Stromberg; this is well within
your power to accomplish.’ She then returned to her swans and drove to
the golden castle of Stromberg.

When the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping, he was grieved
at heart, and said, ‘She has no doubt been here and driven away again,
and it is now too late for me to save her.’ Then his eyes fell on the
things which were lying beside him; he read the letter, and knew from it
all that had happened. He rose up without delay, eager to start on his
way and to reach the castle of Stromberg, but he had no idea in which
direction he ought to go. He travelled about a long time in search of it
and came at last to a dark forest, through which he went on walking for
fourteen days and still could not find a way out. Once more the night
came on, and worn out he lay down under a tree and fell asleep. Again
the next day he pursued his way through the forest, and that evening,
thinking to rest again, he lay down as before, but he heard such a
howling and wailing that he found it impossible to sleep. He waited till
it was darker and people had begun to light up their houses, and then
seeing a little glimmer ahead of him, he went towards it.

He found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than
it really was, from the contrast of its height with that of an immense
giant who stood in front of it. He thought to himself, ‘If the giant
sees me going in, my life will not be worth much.’ However, after a
while he summoned up courage and went forward. When the giant saw him,
he called out, ‘It is lucky for that you have come, for I have not had
anything to eat for a long time. I can have you now for my supper.’ ‘I
would rather you let that alone,’ said the man, ‘for I do not willingly
give myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food I have enough to
satisfy your hunger.’ ‘If that is so,’ replied the giant, ‘I will leave
you in peace; I only thought of eating you because I had nothing else.’

So they went indoors together and sat down, and the man brought out the
bread, meat, and wine, which although he had eaten and drunk of them,
were still unconsumed. The giant was pleased with the good cheer, and
ate and drank to his heart’s content. When he had finished his supper
the man asked him if he could direct him to the castle of Stromberg.
The giant said, ‘I will look on my map; on it are marked all the towns,
villages, and houses.’ So he fetched his map, and looked for the castle,
but could not find it. ‘Never mind,’ he said, ‘I have larger maps
upstairs in the cupboard, we will look on those,’ but they searched"

An aged count once lived in Switzerland, who had an only son, but he
was stupid, and could learn nothing. Then said the father: ‘Hark you,
my son, try as I will I can get nothing into your head. You must go from
hence, I will give you into the care of a celebrated master, who shall
see what he can do with you.’ The youth was sent into a strange town,
and remained a whole year with the master. At the end of this time,
he came home again, and his father asked: ‘Now, my son, what have you
learnt?’ ‘Father, I have learnt what the dogs say when they bark.’ ‘Lord
have mercy on us!’ cried the father; ‘is that all you have learnt? I
will send you into another town, to another master.’ The youth was taken
thither, and stayed a year with this master likewise. When he came back
the father again asked: ‘My son, what have you learnt?’ He answered:
‘Father, I have learnt what the birds say.’ Then the father fell into a
rage and said: ‘Oh, you lost man, you have spent the precious time and
learnt nothing; are you not ashamed to appear before my eyes? I will
send you to a third master, but if you learn nothing this time also, I
will no longer be your father.’ The youth remained a whole year with the
third master also, and when he came home again, and his father inquired:
‘My son, what have you learnt?’ he answered: ‘Dear father, I have this
year learnt what the frogs croak.’ Then the father fell into the most
furious anger, sprang up, called his people thither, and said: ‘This man
is no longer my son, I drive him forth, and command you to take him
out into the forest, and kill him.’ They took him forth, but when they
should have killed him, they could not do it for pity, and let him go,
and they cut the eyes and tongue out of a deer that they might carry
them to the old man as a token.

The youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress where he
begged for a night’s lodging. ‘Yes,’ said the lord of the castle, ‘if
you will pass the night down there in the old tower, go thither; but I
warn you, it is at the peril of your life, for it is full of wild dogs,
which bark and howl without stopping, and at certain hours a man has to
be given to them, whom they at once devour.’ The whole district was in
sorrow and dismay because of them, and yet no one could do anything to
stop this. The youth, however, was without fear, and said: ‘Just let me
go down to the barking dogs, and give me something that I can throw to
them; they will do nothing to harm me.’ As he himself would have it so,
they gave him some food for the wild animals, and led him down to the
tower. When he went inside, the dogs did not bark at him, but wagged
their tails quite amicably around him, ate what he set before them, and
did not hurt one hair of his head. Next morning, to the astonishment of
everyone, he came out again safe and unharmed, and said to the lord of
the castle: ‘The dogs have revealed to me, in their own language, why
they dwell there, and bring evil on the land. They are bewitched, and
are obliged to watch over a great treasure which is below in the tower,
and they can have no rest until it is taken away, and I have likewise
learnt, from their discourse, how that is to be done.’ Then all who
heard this rejoiced, and the lord of the castle said he would adopt him
as a son if he accomplished it successfully. He went down again, and
as he knew what he had to do, he did it thoroughly, and brought a chest
full of gold out with him. The howling of the wild dogs was henceforth
heard no more; they had disappeared, and the country was freed from the
trouble.

After some time he took it in his head that he would travel to Rome. On
the way he passed by a marsh, in which a number of frogs were sitting
croaking. He listened to them, and when he became aware of what they
were saying, he grew very thoughtful and sad. At last he arrived in
Rome, where the Pope had just died, and there was great doubt among
the cardinals as to whom they should appoint as his successor. They at
length agreed that the person should be chosen as pope who should be
distinguished by some divine and miraculous token. And just as that was
decided on, the young count entered into the church, and suddenly two
snow-white doves flew on his shoulders and remained sitting there. The
ecclesiastics recognized therein the token from above, and asked him on
the spot if he would be pope. He was undecided, and knew not if he were
worthy of this, but the doves counselled him to do it, and at length he
said yes. Then was he anointed and consecrated, and thus was fulfilled
what he had heard from the frogs on his way, which had so affected him,
that he was to be his Holiness the Pope. Then he had to sing a mass, and
did not know one word of it, but the two doves sat continually on his
shoulders, and said it all in his ear.
There was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie. And
when she had grown up her father said: ‘We will get her married.’ ‘Yes,’
said the mother, ‘if only someone would come who would have her.’ At
length a man came from a distance and wooed her, who was called Hans;
but he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really smart. ‘Oh,’ said
the father, ‘she has plenty of good sense’; and the mother said: ‘Oh,
she can see the wind coming up the street, and hear the flies coughing.’
‘Well,’ said Hans, ‘if she is not really smart, I won’t have her.’ When
they were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said: ‘Elsie, go
into the cellar and fetch some beer.’ Then Clever Elsie took the pitcher
from the wall, went into the cellar, and tapped the lid briskly as she
went, so that the time might not appear long. When she was below she
fetched herself a chair, and set it before the barrel so that she had
no need to stoop, and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected
injury. Then she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and
while the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle, but
looked up at the wall, and after much peering here and there, saw a
pick-axe exactly above her, which the masons had accidentally left
there.

Then Clever Elsie began to weep and said: ‘If I get Hans, and we have
a child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to draw
beer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then she
sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the
misfortune which lay before her. Those upstairs waited for the drink,
but Clever Elsie still did not come. Then the woman said to the servant:
‘Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is.’ The maid went and
found her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly. ‘Elsie why
do you weep?’ asked the maid. ‘Ah,’ she answered, ‘have I not reason to
weep? If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to
draw beer here, the pick-axe will perhaps fall on his head, and kill
him.’ Then said the maid: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down
beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune. After a while,
as the maid did not come back, and those upstairs were thirsty for the
beer, the man said to the boy: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see
where Elsie and the girl are.’ The boy went down, and there sat Clever
Elsie and the girl both weeping together. Then he asked: ‘Why are you
weeping?’ ‘Ah,’ said Elsie, ‘have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans,
and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the
pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then said the boy: ‘What
a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down by her, and likewise began to
howl loudly. Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he still did not
return, the man said to the woman: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see
where Elsie is!’ The woman went down, and found all three in the midst
of their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then Elsie told
her also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it
grew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down. Then said the
mother likewise: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down and wept
with them. The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not
come back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said: ‘I must go into the
cellar myself and see where Elsie is.’ But when he got into the cellar,
and they were all sitting together crying, and he heard the reason, and
that Elsie’s child was the cause, and the Elsie might perhaps bring one
into the world some day, and that he might be killed by the pick-axe, if
he should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very
time when it fell down, he cried: ‘Oh, what a clever Elsie!’ and sat
down, and likewise wept with them. The bridegroom stayed upstairs alone
for a long time; then as no one would come back he thought: ‘They must be
waiting for me below: I too must go there and see what they are about.’
When he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting
quite piteously, each out-doing the other. ‘What misfortune has happened
then?’ asked he. ‘Ah, dear Hans,’ said Elsie, ‘if we marry each other
and have a child, and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw
something to drink, then the pick-axe which has been left up there might
dash his brains out if it were to fall down, so have we not reason to
weep?’ ‘Come,’ said Hans, ‘more understanding than that is not needed
for my household, as you are such a clever Elsie, I will have you,’ and
seized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her.

After Hans had had her some time, he said: ‘Wife, I am going out to work
and earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the corn that we
may have some bread.’ ‘Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.’ After Hans had
gone away, she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field
with her. When she came to the field she said to herself: ‘What shall I
do; shall I cut first, or shall I eat first? Oh, I will eat first.’ Then
she drank her cup of broth and when she was fully satisfied, she once
more said: ‘What shall I do? Shall I cut first, or shall I sleep first?
I will sleep first.’ Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep.
Hans had been at home for a long time, but Elsie did not come; then said
he: ‘What a clever Elsie I have; she is so industrious that she does not
even come home to eat.’ But when evening came and she still stayed away,
Hans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she
was lying among the corn asleep. Then Hans hastened home and brought
a fowler’s net with little bells and hung it round about her, and she
still went on sleeping. Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat
down in his chair and worked. At length, when it was quite dark, Clever
Elsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about
her, and the bells rang at each step which she took. Then she was
alarmed, and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie or
not, and said: ‘Is it I, or is it not I?’ But she knew not what answer
to make to this, and stood for a time in doubt; at length she thought:
‘I will go home and ask if it be I, or if it be not I, they will be sure
to know.’ She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut; then
she knocked at the window and cried: ‘Hans, is Elsie within?’ ‘Yes,’
answered Hans, ‘she is within.’ Hereupon she was terrified, and said:
‘Ah, heavens! Then it is not I,’ and went to another door; but when the
people heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it, and she
could get in nowhere. Then she ran out of the village, and no one has
seen her since.

It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to
herself: ‘He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the
world,’ she spoke to him in a friendly way. ‘Good day, dear Mr Fox,
how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard
times?’ The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from
head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give
any answer or not. At last he said: ‘Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you
piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have
you the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How
many arts do you understand?’ ‘I understand but one,’ replied the
cat, modestly. ‘What art is that?’ asked the fox. ‘When the hounds are
following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.’ ‘Is that all?’
said the fox. ‘I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain
a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will
teach you how people get away from the hounds.’ Just then came a hunter
with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top
of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. ‘Open your
sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,’ cried the cat to him, but the dogs had
already seized him, and were holding him fast. ‘Ah, Mr Fox,’ cried the
cat. ‘You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been
able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.’

There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so
the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he
did spill a little of anything.

","Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between the mountains, lived an old woman named Agnes. She was known far and wide for her wisdom and kindness, but as she grew older, her memory began to fade. Her children and grandchildren grew frustrated with her forgetfulness, and she was often left alone, eating her meals in silence.

One day, as Agnes sat by the fire, her granddaughter, little Liesel, watched her with sad eyes. She noticed that her grandmother's spoon would occasionally slip from her trembling hands, spilling the soup onto the tablecloth. Liesel, full of compassion, decided to make a special bowl for her grandmother, so she could eat comfortably once more.

Liesel gathered some clay from the nearby riverbank and began to mold it into a bowl shape. She worked diligently, her small hands moving with surprising skill. When the bowl was finished, she proudly presented it to her grandmother, who tears welled up in her eyes.

From that day forward, Agnes was allowed to eat at the table with her family, and no one scolded her if she spilled a drop of soup. The village folk began to talk about the kindness of the young girl, and they marveled at the wisdom of her grandmother, who had taught her such a valuable lesson.

One day, as Agnes sat at the table, her granddaughter asked her, ""Grandmother, what is the secret to a long and happy life?"" Agnes, with a twinkle in her eye, replied, ""Liesel, the secret is to always be kind, to always help others, and to never forget the lessons of love and compassion.""

And so, Agnes and Liesel continued to live happily, sharing their wisdom and love with the village folk. The End."

A shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old,
and had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wife
were standing together before the house the shepherd said, ‘I will shoot
old Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.’ But his wife
said, ‘Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a
great many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of
his days.’ ‘But what can we do with him?’ said the shepherd, ‘he has not
a tooth in his head, and the thieves don’t care for him at all; to
be sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood;
tomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.’

Poor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd
and his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think
tomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good
friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows,
and how his master meant to kill him in the morning. ‘Make yourself
easy,’ said the wolf, ‘I will give you some good advice. Your master,
you know, goes out every morning very early with his wife into the
field; and they take their little child with them, and lay it down
behind the hedge in the shade while they are at work. Now do you lie
down close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come
out of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as
you can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they
will think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you
that they will take care of you as long as you live.’ The dog liked this
plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed. The wolf ran with the
child a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan
soon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master
and mistress. Then the shepherd patted him on the head, and said, ‘Old
Sultan has saved our child from the wolf, and therefore he shall live
and be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat. Wife, go home, and
give him a good dinner, and let him have my old cushion to sleep on
as long as he lives.’ So from this time forward Sultan had all that he
could wish for.

Soon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, ‘Now, my
good fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way
when I want to taste one of the old shepherd’s fine fat sheep.’ ‘No,’
said the Sultan; ‘I will be true to my master.’ However, the wolf
thought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel. But
Sultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait
for him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for
a good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed
his locks for him finely.

Then the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan ‘an old rogue,’ and
swore he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf sent the
boar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter. Now
Sultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd’s old
three-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped
along with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air.

The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they
espied their enemies coming, and saw the cat’s long tail standing
straight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to
fight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up
a stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of
fighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped
up into a tree. Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked about and
wondered that no one was there. The boar, however, had not quite hidden
himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of
them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a
mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped
up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, ‘Look up in the tree, there
sits the one who is to blame.’ So they looked up, and espied the wolf
sitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal,
and would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of
himself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.
There was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest:
but still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he
had in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of
shoes.

Then he cut his leather out, all ready to make up the next day, meaning
to rise early in the morning to his work. His conscience was clear and
his heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed,
left all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep. In the morning after
he had said his prayers, he sat himself down to his work; when, to his
great wonder, there stood the shoes all ready made, upon the table. The
good man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening.
He looked at the workmanship; there was not one false stitch in the
whole job; all was so neat and true, that it was quite a masterpiece.

The same day a customer came in, and the shoes suited him so well that
he willingly paid a price higher than usual for them; and the poor
shoemaker, with the money, bought leather enough to make two pairs more.
In the evening he cut out the work, and went to bed early, that he might
get up and begin betimes next day; but he was saved all the trouble, for
when he got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand. Soon
in came buyers, who paid him handsomely for his goods, so that he bought
leather enough for four pair more. He cut out the work again overnight
and found it done in the morning, as before; and so it went on for some
time: what was got ready in the evening was always done by daybreak, and
the good man soon became thriving and well off again.

One evening, about Christmas-time, as he and his wife were sitting over
the fire chatting together, he said to her, ‘I should like to sit up and
watch tonight, that we may see who it is that comes and does my work for
me.’ The wife liked the thought; so they left a light burning, and hid
themselves in a corner of the room, behind a curtain that was hung up
there, and watched what would happen.

As soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs; and
they sat themselves upon the shoemaker’s bench, took up all the work
that was cut out, and began to ply with their little fingers, stitching
and rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that the shoemaker was all
wonder, and could not take his eyes off them. And on they went, till the
job was quite done, and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table.
This was long before daybreak; and then they bustled away as quick as
lightning.

The next day the wife said to the shoemaker. ‘These little wights have
made us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them a good
turn if we can. I am quite sorry to see them run about as they do; and
indeed it is not very decent, for they have nothing upon their backs to
keep off the cold. I’ll tell you what, I will make each of them a shirt,
and a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain; and
do you make each of them a little pair of shoes.’

The thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening, when
all the things were ready, they laid them on the table, instead of the
work that they used to cut out, and then went and hid themselves, to
watch what the little elves would do.

About midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the
room, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they
saw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed
mightily delighted.

Then they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and danced and
capered and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at last they danced
out at the door, and away over the green.

The good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them
from that time forward, as long as they lived.

It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to
herself: ‘He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the
world,’ she spoke to him in a friendly way. ‘Good day, dear Mr Fox,
how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard
times?’ The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from
head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give
any answer or not. At last he said: ‘Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you
piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have
you the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How
many arts do you understand?’ ‘I understand but one,’ replied the
cat, modestly. ‘What art is that?’ asked the fox. ‘When the hounds are
following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.’ ‘Is that all?’
said the fox. ‘I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain
a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will
teach you how people get away from the hounds.’ Just then came a hunter
with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top
of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. ‘Open your
sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,’ cried the cat to him, but the dogs had
already seized him, and were holding him fast. ‘Ah, Mr Fox,’ cried the
cat. ‘You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been
able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.’

There was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with
two oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two
talers. When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that
the doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how well he
ate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and would willingly
have been a doctor too. So he remained standing a while, and at length
inquired if he too could not be a doctor. ‘Oh, yes,’ said the doctor,
‘that is soon managed.’ ‘What must I do?’ asked the peasant. ‘In the
first place buy yourself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on
the frontispiece; in the second, turn your cart and your two oxen into
money, and get yourself some clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to
medicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for yourself with the words: “I
am Doctor Knowall,” and have that nailed up above your house-door.’ The
peasant did everything that he had been told to do. When he had doctored
people awhile, but not long, a rich and great lord had some money
stolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such
a village, and must know what had become of the money. So the lord had
the horses harnessed to his carriage, drove out to the village, and
asked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall. Yes, he was, he said. Then he was
to go with him and bring back the stolen money. ‘Oh, yes, but Grete, my
wife, must go too.’ The lord was willing, and let both of them have a
seat in the carriage, and they all drove away together. When they came
to the nobleman’s castle, the table was spread, and Crabb was told to
sit down and eat. ‘Yes, but my wife, Grete, too,’ said he, and he seated
himself with her at the table. And when the first servant came with a
dish of delicate fare, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: ‘Grete,
that was the first,’ meaning that was the servant who brought the first
dish. The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say: ‘That is
the first thief,’ and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said
to his comrade outside: ‘The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he
said I was the first.’ The second did not want to go in at all, but was
forced. So when he went in with his dish, the peasant nudged his wife,
and said: ‘Grete, that is the second.’ This servant was equally alarmed,
and he got out as fast as he could. The third fared no better, for the
peasant again said: ‘Grete, that is the third.’ The fourth had to carry
in a dish that was covered, and the lord told the doctor that he was to
show his skill, and guess what was beneath the cover. Actually, there
were crabs. The doctor looked at the dish, had no idea what to say, and
cried: ‘Ah, poor Crabb.’ When the lord heard that, he cried: ‘There! he
knows it; he must also know who has the money!’

On this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the
doctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When therefore
he went out, all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen
the money, and said that they would willingly restore it and give him a
heavy sum into the bargain, if he would not denounce them, for if he
did they would be hanged. They led him to the spot where the money was
concealed. With this the doctor was satisfied, and returned to the hall,
sat down to the table, and said: ‘My lord, now will I search in my book
where the gold is hidden.’ The fifth servant, however, crept into the
stove to hear if the doctor knew still more. But the doctor sat still
and opened his A B C book, turned the pages backwards and forwards, and
looked for the cock. As he could not find it immediately he said: ‘I
know you are there, so you had better come out!’ Then the fellow in the
stove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out,
crying: ‘That man knows everything!’ Then Doctor Knowall showed the lord
where the money was, but did not say who had stolen it, and received
from both sides much money in reward, and became a renowned man.

","In a small village, there lived a poor miller named Hans. He had a faithful horse named Max, who had served him well for many years. One day, Hans said to his wife, ""I must sell Max tomorrow. He is old and no longer useful. He can barely walk.""

But his wife pleaded, ""Let him live, dear Hans. He has served us faithfully all these years. We should let him live out his days in peace.""

Max, who was lying nearby, heard the conversation. He was frightened at the thought of his master selling him the next day. In the evening, he went to see his friend, the fox, who lived in the nearby forest, and told him of his troubles.

The fox said, ""I have an idea. Your master takes his loaf of bread to the market every day. When he is gone, you must hide behind the loaf and pretend to be guarding it. I will come and steal the bread, and you can follow me, and when I drop it, you can bring it back to your master.""

Max agreed to the plan. The next day, when Hans and his wife went to the market, Max hid behind the loaf of bread. The fox came and stole it, and Max followed him, managing to retrieve the loaf before the fox could get too far.

When they returned, Hans and his wife were surprised and happy to see Max with the loaf of bread. Hans patted Max on the head and said, ""You have saved our bread, old Max. You shall live and be well taken care of.""

A few days later, the fox came to Max and said, ""I need a favor from you. I have a bet with the wolf that I can outrun any animal. Will you help me win the bet?""

Max agreed, but he had no one to ask to be his second but the old cat who lived in his barn. So he took her with him, and as she limped along with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air.

The wolf and the fox were first on the ground. When they saw the cat's long tail standing straight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Max to fight with. Every time she limped, they thought she was picking up a stone to throw at them. So they said they should not like this way of fighting, and the wolf jumped up into a tree.

Max and the cat soon came up, and looked about and wondered that no one was there. The wolf, however, had not quite hidden himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush. When he shook one of them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the wolf jumped up and roared out, ""Look up in the tree, there sits the one who is to blame.""

The fox was very angry and called Max a coward. He swore he would have his revenge. The next day, the fox sent the boar to challenge Max to come into the forest to fight the matter. Max had no one he could ask to be his second but the old three-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as she limped along with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air.

The fox was very angry, and called Max a coward. He swore he would have his revenge. So the next morning, the fox sent the bear to challenge Max to come into the forest to fight the matter.

One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went
out to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool
spring of water, that rose in the midst of it, she sat herself down
to rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her
favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and
catching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high that
she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled
along upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring. The
princess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so
deep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she began to bewail
her loss, and said, ‘Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would
give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the
world.’

Whilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said,
‘Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘what can you
do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.’
The frog said, ‘I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes;
but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off
your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball
again.’ ‘What nonsense,’ thought the princess, ‘this silly frog is
talking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though
he may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he
shall have what he asks.’ So she said to the frog, ‘Well, if you will
bring me my ball, I will do all you ask.’ Then the frog put his head
down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came
up again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the
spring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick
it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she
never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could.
The frog called after her, ‘Stay, princess, and take me with you as you
said,’ But she did not stop to hear a word.

The next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a
strange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the
marble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the
door, and a little voice cried out and said:

 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here!
  And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

Then the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw
the frog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly
frightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her
seat. The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her,
asked her what was the matter. ‘There is a nasty frog,’ said she, ‘at
the door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: I
told him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never
get out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come
in.’

While she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:

 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here!
  And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

Then the king said to the young princess, ‘As you have given your word
you must keep it; so go and let him in.’ She did so, and the frog hopped
into the room, and then straight on--tap, tap--plash, plash--from the
bottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where
the princess sat. ‘Pray lift me upon chair,’ said he to the princess,
‘and let me sit next to you.’ As soon as she had done this, the frog
said, ‘Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.’ This
she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, ‘Now I am
tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.’ And the princess,
though very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the
pillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was
light he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house.
‘Now, then,’ thought the princess, ‘at last he is gone, and I shall be
troubled with him no more.’

But she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same
tapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:

 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here!
  And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

And when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon
her pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he did
the same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was
astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her
with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head
of her bed.

He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had
changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till
some princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from
her plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. ‘You,’ said the
prince, ‘have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for
but that you should go with me into my father’s kingdom, where I will
marry you, and love you as long as you live.’

The young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying ‘Yes’ to
all this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful
horses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind
the coach rode the prince’s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed
the misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so
bitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.

They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight
horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince’s
kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great
many years.
There was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy
wood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy could take
any shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of
an owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always
became an old woman again. When any young man came within a hundred
paces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step
till she came and set him free; which she would not do till he had given
her his word never to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came
within that space she was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her
into a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the castle. There were
seven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle, and all with
beautiful birds in them.

Now there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier
than all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd
lad, whose name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon
to be married. One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be
alone; and Jorindel said, ‘We must take care that we don’t go too near
to the fairy’s castle.’ It was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the
setting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon
the green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall
birches.

Jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and
both felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be
parted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way; and when
they looked to see which way they should go home, they found themselves
at a loss to know what path to take.

The sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk behind
the hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw through the
bushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close under the old
walls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled.
Jorinda was just singing,

 ‘The ring-dove sang from the willow spray,
  Well-a-day! Well-a-day!
  He mourn’d for the fate of his darling mate,
  Well-a-day!’

when her song stopped suddenly. Jorindel turned to see the reason, and
beheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale, so that her song ended
with a mournful _jug, jug_. An owl with fiery eyes flew three times
round them, and three times screamed:

 ‘Tu whu! Tu whu! Tu whu!’

Jorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither
weep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot. And now the sun went quite down;
the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the
old fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and
chin that almost met one another.

She mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went away
with it in her hand. Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gone--but
what could he do? He could not speak, he could not move from the spot
where he stood. At last the fairy came back and sang with a hoarse
voice:

 ‘Till the prisoner is fast,
  And her doom is cast,
  There stay! Oh, stay!
  When the charm is around her,
  And the spell has bound her,
  Hie away! away!’

On a sudden Jorindel found himself free. Then he fell on his knees
before the fairy, and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda: but
she laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then she
went her way.

He prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain. ‘Alas!’ he said, ‘what
will become of me?’ He could not go back to his own home, so he went to
a strange village, and employed himself in keeping sheep. Many a time
did he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go,
but all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.

At last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower,
and that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he
plucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and
that everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he
found his Jorinda again.

In the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale for
this pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but
on the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple
flower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly
pearl. Then he plucked the flower, and set out and travelled day and
night, till he came again to the castle.

He walked nearer than a hundred paces to it, and yet he did not become
fixed as before, but found that he could go quite close up to the door.
Jorindel was very glad indeed to see this. Then he touched the door with
the flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court,
and listened when he heard so many birds singing. At last he came to the
chamber where the fairy sat, with the seven hundred birds singing in
the seven hundred cages. When she saw Jorindel she was very angry, and
screamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him, for
the flower he held in his hand was his safeguard. He looked around at
the birds, but alas! there were many, many nightingales, and how then
should he find out which was his Jorinda? While he was thinking what to
do, he saw the fairy had taken down one of the cages, and was making the
best of her way off through the door. He ran or flew after her, touched
the cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her
arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when
they walked together in the wood.

Then he touched all the other birds with the flower, so that they all
took their old forms again; and he took Jorinda home, where they were
married, and lived happily together many years: and so did a good many
other lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy’s
cages by themselves, much longer than they liked.

There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so
the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he
did spill a little of anything.

It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to
herself: ‘He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the
world,’ she spoke to him in a friendly way. ‘Good day, dear Mr Fox,
how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard
times?’ The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from
head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give
any answer or not. At last he said: ‘Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you
piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have
you the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How
many arts do you understand?’ ‘I understand but one,’ replied the
cat, modestly. ‘What art is that?’ asked the fox. ‘When the hounds are
following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.’ ‘Is that all?’
said the fox. ‘I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain
a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will
teach you how people get away from the hounds.’ Just then came a hunter
with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top
of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. ‘Open your
sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,’ cried the cat to him, but the dogs had
already seized him, and were holding him fast. ‘Ah, Mr Fox,’ cried the
cat. ‘You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been
able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.’

","One fine day a young prince went out for a walk in the forest, and when he came to a clear stream, he sat down to rest a while. He had a golden apple in his hand, which was his favorite toy, and he was constantly tossing it up in the air and catching it as it fell. After a while, he threw it up so high that he missed catching it as it fell; and the apple bounced away, and rolled along upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the stream. The prince looked into the stream after his apple, but it was very deep, so deep that he could not see the bottom of it. Then he began to weep bitterly, and said, “Alas! If I could only get my apple again, I would give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the world.”

Whilst he was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said, “Prince, why do you weep so bitterly?” “Alas!” said he, “what can you do for me, you nasty frog? My golden apple has fallen into the stream.” The frog said, “I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes; but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your apple again.” “What nonsense,” thought the prince, “this silly frog is talking!

   By the stream cool, in the greenwood shade.”

Then the prince ran to the door and opened it, and there he saw the frog, whom he had quite forgotten. At this sight he was sadly frightened, and shutting the door as fast as he could came back to his seat. The king, his father, seeing that something had frightened him, asked him what was the matter. “There is a nasty frog,” said he, “at the door, that lifted my apple for me out of the stream this morning: I told him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never get out of the stream; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come in.”

While he was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:

 “Open the door, my prince dear,
   Open the door to thy true love here!
   And mind the words that thou and I said
   By the stream cool, in the greenwood shade.”

Then the king said to the young prince, “As you have given your word you must keep it; so go and let him in.” He did so, and the frog hopped into the room, and then straight on--tap, tap--plash, plash--from the bottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where the prince sat. “Pray lift me upon chair,” said he to the prince, “and let me sit next to you.” As soon as he had done this, the frog said, “Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.” This he did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, “Now I am tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.” And the prince, though very unwilling, took him up in his hand, and put him upon the pillow of his own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was light he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house. “Now, then,” thought the prince, “at last he is gone, and I shall be troubled with him no more.”

But he was mistaken; for when night came again he heard the same tapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:

 “Open the door, my prince dear,
   Open the door to thy true love here!
   And mind the words that thou and I said
   By the stream cool, in the greenwood shade.”

And when the prince opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon his pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he did the same. But when the prince awoke on the following morning he was astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on him with the most beautiful eyes he had ever seen, and standing at the head of his bed.

He told him that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till some prince should take him out of the stream, and let him eat from his plate, and sleep upon his bed for three nights. “You, prince,” said the enchanted prince, “have broken my cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for but that you should go with me into my father’s kingdom, where I will marry you, and love you as long as you live.”

The young prince, you may be sure, was not long in saying “Yes” to all this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful horses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind the coach rode the enchanted prince’s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed the misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so bitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.

They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the enchanted prince’s kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great many years.
There was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy wood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy could take any shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of an owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always became an old woman again. When any young man came within a hundred paces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step till she came and set him free; which she would not do till he had given her his word never to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came within that space she was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her into a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the castle. There were seven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle, and all with beautiful birds in them.

Now there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier than all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd lad, whose name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon to be married. One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be alone; and Jorindel said, “We must take"

Once upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters; one of them
was beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy. The mother,
however, loved the ugly and lazy one best, because she was her own
daughter, and so the other, who was only her stepdaughter, was made
to do all the work of the house, and was quite the Cinderella of the
family. Her stepmother sent her out every day to sit by the well in
the high road, there to spin until she made her fingers bleed. Now it
chanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle, and as the girl
stopped over the well to wash it off, the spindle suddenly sprang out
of her hand and fell into the well. She ran home crying to tell of her
misfortune, but her stepmother spoke harshly to her, and after giving
her a violent scolding, said unkindly, ‘As you have let the spindle fall
into the well you may go yourself and fetch it out.’

The girl went back to the well not knowing what to do, and at last in
her distress she jumped into the water after the spindle.

She remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in a
beautiful meadow, full of sunshine, and with countless flowers blooming
in every direction.

She walked over the meadow, and presently she came upon a baker’s oven
full of bread, and the loaves cried out to her, ‘Take us out, take us
out, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long
ago.’ So she took the bread-shovel and drew them all out.

She went on a little farther, till she came to a tree full of apples.
‘Shake me, shake me, I pray,’ cried the tree; ‘my apples, one and all,
are ripe.’ So she shook the tree, and the apples came falling down upon
her like rain; but she continued shaking until there was not a single
apple left upon it. Then she carefully gathered the apples together in a
heap and walked on again.

The next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an old
woman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified, and
turned to run away. But the old woman called after her, ‘What are you
afraid of, dear child? Stay with me; if you will do the work of my house
properly for me, I will make you very happy. You must be very careful,
however, to make my bed in the right way, for I wish you always to shake
it thoroughly, so that the feathers fly about; then they say, down there
in the world, that it is snowing; for I am Mother Holle.’ The old woman
spoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter
into her service.

She took care to do everything according to the old woman’s bidding and
every time she made the bed she shook it with all her might, so that the
feathers flew about like so many snowflakes. The old woman was as good
as her word: she never spoke angrily to her, and gave her roast and
boiled meats every day.

So she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began
to grow unhappy. She could not at first tell why she felt sad, but she
became conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew she
was homesick, although she was a thousand times better off with Mother
Holle than with her mother and sister. After waiting awhile, she went
to Mother Holle and said, ‘I am so homesick, that I cannot stay with
you any longer, for although I am so happy here, I must return to my own
people.’

Then Mother Holle said, ‘I am pleased that you should want to go back
to your own people, and as you have served me so well and faithfully, I
will take you home myself.’

Thereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway. The gate
was opened, and as the girl passed through, a shower of gold fell upon
her, and the gold clung to her, so that she was covered with it from
head to foot.

‘That is a reward for your industry,’ said Mother Holle, and as she
spoke she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well.

The gate was then closed, and the girl found herself back in the old
world close to her mother’s house. As she entered the courtyard, the
cock who was perched on the well, called out:

 ‘Cock-a-doodle-doo!
  Your golden daughter’s come back to you.’

Then she went in to her mother and sister, and as she was so richly
covered with gold, they gave her a warm welcome. She related to them
all that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by her
great riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter to go
and try her fortune. So she made the sister go and sit by the well
and spin, and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into a
thorn-bush, so that she might drop some blood on to the spindle; then
she threw it into the well, and jumped in herself.

Like her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow, and walked over it
till she came to the oven. ‘Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall
be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago,’ cried the loaves
as before. But the lazy girl answered, ‘Do you think I am going to dirty
my hands for you?’ and walked on.

Presently she came to the apple-tree. ‘Shake me, shake me, I pray; my
apples, one and all, are ripe,’ it cried. But she only answered, ‘A nice
thing to ask me to do, one of the apples might fall on my head,’ and
passed on.

At last she came to Mother Holle’s house, and as she had heard all about
the large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and engaged
herself without delay to the old woman.

The first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted herself
to please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should get in
return. The next day, however, she began to dawdle over her work, and
the third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie in bed in
the mornings and refused to get up. Worse still, she neglected to
make the old woman’s bed properly, and forgot to shake it so that the
feathers might fly about. So Mother Holle very soon got tired of her,
and told her she might go. The lazy girl was delighted at this, and
thought to herself, ‘The gold will soon be mine.’ Mother Holle led her,
as she had led her sister, to the broad gateway; but as she was passing
through, instead of the shower of gold, a great bucketful of pitch came
pouring over her.

‘That is in return for your services,’ said the old woman, and she shut
the gate.

So the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch, and the cock on the
well called out as she saw her:

 ‘Cock-a-doodle-doo!
  Your dirty daughter’s come back to you.’

But, try what she would, she could not get the pitch off and it stuck to
her as long as she lived.
A king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way off,
where there were in those days fairies. Now this king and queen had
plenty of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of
good things to eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day: but
though they had been married many years they had no children, and this
grieved them very much indeed. But one day as the queen was walking
by the side of the river, at the bottom of the garden, she saw a poor
little fish, that had thrown itself out of the water, and lay gasping
and nearly dead on the bank. Then the queen took pity on the little
fish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away
it lifted its head out of the water and said, ‘I know what your wish is,
and it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me--you will
soon have a daughter.’ What the little fish had foretold soon came to
pass; and the queen had a little girl, so very beautiful that the king
could not cease looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great
feast and make merry, and show the child to all the land. So he asked
his kinsmen, and nobles, and friends, and neighbours. But the queen
said, ‘I will have the fairies also, that they might be kind and good
to our little daughter.’ Now there were thirteen fairies in the kingdom;
but as the king and queen had only twelve golden dishes for them to eat
out of, they were forced to leave one of the fairies without asking her.
So twelve fairies came, each with a high red cap on her head, and red
shoes with high heels on her feet, and a long white wand in her hand:
and after the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave all
their best gifts to the little princess. One gave her goodness, another
beauty, another riches, and so on till she had all that was good in the
world.

Just as eleven of them had done blessing her, a great noise was heard in
the courtyard, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was
come, with a black cap on her head, and black shoes on her feet, and a
broomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the dining-hall.
Now, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and
scolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her
revenge. So she cried out, ‘The king’s daughter shall, in her fifteenth
year, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.’ Then the twelfth of
the friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift, came forward, and
said that the evil wish must be fulfilled, but that she could soften its
mischief; so her gift was, that the king’s daughter, when the spindle
wounded her, should not really die, but should only fall asleep for a
hundred years.

However, the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from
the threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom
should be bought up and burnt. But all the gifts of the first eleven
fairies were in the meantime fulfilled; for the princess was so
beautiful, and well behaved, and good, and wise, that everyone who knew
her loved her.

It happened that, on the very day she was fifteen years old, the king
and queen were not at home, and she was left alone in the palace. So she
roved about by herself, and looked at all the rooms and chambers, till
at last she came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow staircase
ending with a little door. In the door there was a golden key, and when
she turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning
away very busily. ‘Why, how now, good mother,’ said the princess; ‘what
are you doing there?’ ‘Spinning,’ said the old lady, and nodded her
head, humming a tune, while buzz! went the wheel. ‘How prettily that
little thing turns round!’ said the princess, and took the spindle
and began to try and spin. But scarcely had she touched it, before the
fairy’s prophecy was fulfilled; the spindle wounded her, and she fell
down lifeless on the ground.

However, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and
the king and the queen, who had just come home, and all their court,
fell asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in
the court, the pigeons on the house-top, and the very flies slept upon
the walls. Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went to
sleep; the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a
goose upon it for the king’s dinner stood still; and the cook, who was
at that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box
on the ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell
asleep; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the
jug at his lips: and thus everything stood still, and slept soundly.

A large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace, and every year it
became higher and thicker; till at last the old palace was surrounded
and hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen. But
there went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping Briar
Rose (for so the king’s daughter was called): so that, from time to
time, several kings’ sons came, and tried to break through the thicket
into the palace. This, however, none of them could ever do; for the
thorns and bushes laid hold of them, as it were with hands; and there
they stuck fast, and died wretchedly.

After many, many years there came a king’s son into that land: and an
old man told him the story of the thicket of thorns; and how a beautiful
palace stood behind it, and how a wonderful princess, called Briar Rose,
lay in it asleep, with all her court. He told, too, how he had heard
from his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had tried to
break through the thicket, but that they had all stuck fast in it, and
died. Then the young prince said, ‘All this shall not frighten me; I
will go and see this Briar Rose.’ The old man tried to hinder him, but
he was bent upon going.

Now that very day the hundred years were ended; and as the prince came
to the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs, through
which he went with ease, and they shut in after him as thick as ever.
Then he came at last to the palace, and there in the court lay the dogs
asleep; and the horses were standing in the stables; and on the roof sat
the pigeons fast asleep, with their heads under their wings. And when he
came into the palace, the flies were sleeping on the walls; the spit
was standing still; the butler had the jug of ale at his lips, going
to drink a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to be
plucked; and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand, as
if she was going to beat the boy.

Then he went on still farther, and all was so still that he could hear
every breath he drew; till at last he came to the old tower, and opened
the door of the little room in which Briar Rose was; and there she lay,
fast asleep on a couch by the window. She looked so beautiful that he
could not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.
But the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled
upon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also
awoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder.
And the horses shook themselves, and the dogs jumped up and barked; the
pigeons took their heads from under their wings, and looked about and
flew into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in
the kitchen blazed up; round went the jack, and round went the spit,
with the goose for the king’s dinner upon it; the butler finished his
draught of ale; the maid went on plucking the fowl; and the cook gave
the boy the box on his ear.

And then the prince and Briar Rose were married, and the wedding feast
was given; and they lived happily together all their lives long.

","Once upon a time there was a farmer who had two sons; one of them was hardworking and kind, the other lazy and cruel. The father, however, loved the lazy and cruel one best, because he was his own son, and so the other, who was only his stepson, was made to do all the work of the farm, and was quite the Cinderella of the family. The stepfather sent him out every day to tend the fields and the livestock, and he was given the worst and most difficult tasks to perform. His stepfather spoke harshly to him, and after giving him a violent scolding, said unkindly, ‘As you have let the animals suffer, you may go yourself and tend to them.’

The stepson went out to the fields, and presently he came upon a wounded bird, that had thrown itself down, and lay gasping and nearly dead on the ground. Then the stepson took pity on the bird, and took it home and nursed it back to health. And before it flew away it lifted its head and said, ‘I know what your wish is, and it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me--you will soon have a son.’ What the bird had foretold soon came to pass; and the stepson had a son, so very handsome that the father could not cease looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great feast and make merry, and show the child to all the land.

In the door there was a golden key, and when he turned it the door sprang open, and there lay an old man, who was ploughing away very busily. ‘Why, how now, good man,’ said the prince; ‘what are you doing there?’ ‘Ploughing,’ said the old man, and nodded his head, humming a tune, while buzz! went the plough. ‘How prettily that little thing turns round!’ said the prince, and took the ploughshare and began to try and plough.

There was once a man who had seven sons, and last of all one daughter.
Although the little girl was very pretty, she was so weak and small that
they thought she could not live; but they said she should at once be
christened.

So the father sent one of his sons in haste to the spring to get some
water, but the other six ran with him. Each wanted to be first at
drawing the water, and so they were in such a hurry that all let their
pitchers fall into the well, and they stood very foolishly looking at
one another, and did not know what to do, for none dared go home. In the
meantime the father was uneasy, and could not tell what made the
young men stay so long. ‘Surely,’ said he, ‘the whole seven must have
forgotten themselves over some game of play’; and when he had waited
still longer and they yet did not come, he flew into a rage and wished
them all turned into ravens. Scarcely had he spoken these words when he
heard a croaking over his head, and looked up and saw seven ravens as
black as coal flying round and round. Sorry as he was to see his wish
so fulfilled, he did not know how what was done could be undone, and
comforted himself as well as he could for the loss of his seven sons
with his dear little daughter, who soon became stronger and every day
more beautiful.

For a long time she did not know that she had ever had any brothers; for
her father and mother took care not to speak of them before her: but one
day by chance she heard the people about her speak of them. ‘Yes,’ said
they, ‘she is beautiful indeed, but still ‘tis a pity that her brothers
should have been lost for her sake.’ Then she was much grieved, and went
to her father and mother, and asked if she had any brothers, and what
had become of them. So they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but
said it was the will of Heaven, and that her birth was only the innocent
cause of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day, and
thought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back;
and she had neither rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole
away, and set out into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever
they might be, and free them, whatever it might cost her.

She took nothing with her but a little ring which her father and mother
had given her, a loaf of bread in case she should be hungry, a little
pitcher of water in case she should be thirsty, and a little stool
to rest upon when she should be weary. Thus she went on and on, and
journeyed till she came to the world’s end; then she came to the sun,
but the sun looked much too hot and fiery; so she ran away quickly to
the moon, but the moon was cold and chilly, and said, ‘I smell flesh
and blood this way!’ so she took herself away in a hurry and came to the
stars, and the stars were friendly and kind to her, and each star sat
upon his own little stool; but the morning star rose up and gave her a
little piece of wood, and said, ‘If you have not this little piece of
wood, you cannot unlock the castle that stands on the glass-mountain,
and there your brothers live.’ The little girl took the piece of wood,
rolled it up in a little cloth, and went on again until she came to the
glass-mountain, and found the door shut. Then she felt for the little
piece of wood; but when she unwrapped the cloth it was not there, and
she saw she had lost the gift of the good stars. What was to be done?
She wanted to save her brothers, and had no key of the castle of the
glass-mountain; so this faithful little sister took a knife out of her
pocket and cut off her little finger, that was just the size of the
piece of wood she had lost, and put it in the door and opened it.

As she went in, a little dwarf came up to her, and said, ‘What are you
seeking for?’ ‘I seek for my brothers, the seven ravens,’ answered she.
Then the dwarf said, ‘My masters are not at home; but if you will wait
till they come, pray step in.’ Now the little dwarf was getting their
dinner ready, and he brought their food upon seven little plates, and
their drink in seven little glasses, and set them upon the table, and
out of each little plate their sister ate a small piece, and out of each
little glass she drank a small drop; but she let the ring that she had
brought with her fall into the last glass.

On a sudden she heard a fluttering and croaking in the air, and the
dwarf said, ‘Here come my masters.’ When they came in, they wanted to
eat and drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses. Then said
one after the other,

‘Who has eaten from my little plate? And who has been drinking out of my
little glass?’

 ‘Caw! Caw! well I ween
  Mortal lips have this way been.’

When the seventh came to the bottom of his glass, and found there the
ring, he looked at it, and knew that it was his father’s and mother’s,
and said, ‘O that our little sister would but come! then we should be
free.’ When the little girl heard this (for she stood behind the door
all the time and listened), she ran forward, and in an instant all
the ravens took their right form again; and all hugged and kissed each
other, and went merrily home.
One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went
out to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool
spring of water, that rose in the midst of it, she sat herself down
to rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her
favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and
catching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high that
she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled
along upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring. The
princess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so
deep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she began to bewail
her loss, and said, ‘Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would
give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the
world.’

Whilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said,
‘Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘what can you
do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.’
The frog said, ‘I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes;
but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off
your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball
again.’ ‘What nonsense,’ thought the princess, ‘this silly frog is
talking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though
he may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he
shall have what he asks.’ So she said to the frog, ‘Well, if you will
bring me my ball, I will do all you ask.’ Then the frog put his head
down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came
up again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the
spring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick
it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she
never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could.
The frog called after her, ‘Stay, princess, and take me with you as you
said,’ But she did not stop to hear a word.

The next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a
strange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the
marble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the
door, and a little voice cried out and said:

 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here!
  And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

Then the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw
the frog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly
frightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her
seat. The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her,
asked her what was the matter. ‘There is a nasty frog,’ said she, ‘at
the door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: I
told him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never
get out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come
in.’

While she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:

 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here!
  And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

Then the king said to the young princess, ‘As you have given your word
you must keep it; so go and let him in.’ She did so, and the frog hopped
into the room, and then straight on--tap, tap--plash, plash--from the
bottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where
the princess sat. ‘Pray lift me upon chair,’ said he to the princess,
‘and let me sit next to you.’ As soon as she had done this, the frog
said, ‘Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.’ This
she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, ‘Now I am
tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.’ And the princess,
though very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the
pillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was
light he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house.
‘Now, then,’ thought the princess, ‘at last he is gone, and I shall be
troubled with him no more.’

But she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same
tapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:

 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here!
  And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

And when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon
her pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he did
the same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was
astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her
with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head
of her bed.

He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had
changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till
some princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from
her plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. ‘You,’ said the
prince, ‘have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for
but that you should go with me into my father’s kingdom, where I will
marry you, and love you as long as you live.’

The young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying ‘Yes’ to
all this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful
horses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind
the coach rode the prince’s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed
the misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so
bitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.

They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight
horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince’s
kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great
many years.
===
A farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to
him: but he was now grown too old to work; so the farmer would give him
nothing more to eat, and said, ‘I want you no longer, so take yourself
off out of my stable; I shall not take you back again until you are
stronger than a lion.’ Then he opened the door and turned him adrift.

The poor horse was very melancholy, and wandered up and down in the
wood, seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain. Presently
a fox met him: ‘What’s the matter, my friend?’ said he, ‘why do you hang
down your head and look so lonely and woe-begone?’ ‘Ah!’ replied the
horse, ‘justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has
forgotten all that I have done for him so many years, and because I
can no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless I become
stronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can I
have of that? he knows I have none, or he would not talk so.’

However, the fox bid him be of good cheer, and said, ‘I will help you;
lie down there, stretch yourself out quite stiff, and pretend to be
dead.’ The horse did as he was told, and the fox went straight to the
lion who lived in a cave close by, and said to him, ‘A little way off
lies a dead horse; come with me and you may make an excellent meal of
his carcase.’ The lion was greatly pleased, and set off immediately; and
when they came to the horse, the fox said, ‘You will not be able to eat
him comfortably here; I’ll tell you what--I will tie you fast to
his tail, and then you can draw him to your den, and eat him at your
leisure.’

This advice pleased the lion, so he laid himself down quietly for the
fox to make him fast to the horse. But the fox managed to tie his legs
together and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength he
could not set himself free. When the work was done, the fox clapped the
horse on the shoulder, and said, ‘Jip! Dobbin! Jip!’ Then up he sprang,
and moved off, dragging the lion behind him. The beast began to roar
and bellow, till all the birds of the wood flew away for fright; but the
horse let him sing on, and made his way quietly over the fields to his
master’s house.

‘Here he is, master,’ said he, ‘I have got the better of him’: and when
the farmer saw his old servant, his heart relented, and he said. ‘Thou
shalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of.’ And so the poor old
horse had plenty to eat, and lived--till he died.

","There was once a woman who had seven sons, and last of all one daughter.
Although the little girl was very pretty, she was so weak and small that
they thought she could not live; but they said she should at once be
christened.

So the father sent one of his sons in haste to the stream to get some
water, but the other six ran with him. Each wanted to be first at
drawing the water, and so they were in such a hurry that all let their
pitchers fall into the well, and they stood very foolishly looking at
one another, and did not know what to do, for none dared go home. In the
meantime the father was uneasy, and could not tell what made the
young men stay so long. ‘Surely,’ said he, ‘the whole seven must have
forgotten themselves over some game of play’; and when he had waited
still longer and they yet did not come, he flew into a rage and wished
them all turned into foxes. Scarcely had he spoken these words when he
heard a yipping over his head, and looked up and saw seven foxes as
brown as earth flying round and round. Sorry as he was to see his wish
so fulfilled, he did not know how what was done could be undone, and
comforted himself as well as he could for the loss of his seven sons
with his dear little daughter, who soon became stronger and every day
more beautiful.

For a long time she did not know that she had ever had any brothers; for
her father and mother took care not to speak of them before her: but one
day by chance she heard the people about her speak of them. ‘Yes,’ said
they, ‘she is beautiful indeed, but still ‘tis a pity that her brothers
should have been lost for her sake.’ Then she was much grieved, and went
to her father and mother, and asked if she had any brothers, and what
had become of them. So they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but
said it was the will of Heaven, and that her birth was only the innocent
cause of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day, and
thought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back;
and she had neither rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole
away, and set out into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever
they might be, and free them, whatever it might cost her.

She took nothing with her but a little ring which her father and mother
had given her, a loaf of bread in case she should be hungry, a little
pitcher of water in case she should be thirsty, and a little stool
to rest upon when she should be weary. Thus she went on and on, and
journeyed till she came to the world’s end; then she came to the sun,
but the sun looked much too hot and fiery; so she ran away quickly to
the moon, but the moon was cold and chilly, and said, ‘I smell flesh
and blood this way!’ so she took herself away in a hurry and came to the
stars, and the stars were friendly and kind to her, and each star sat
upon his own little stool; but the morning star rose up and gave her a
little piece of wood, and said, ‘If you have not this little piece of
wood, you cannot unlock the castle that stands on the glass-mountain,
and there your brothers live.’ The little girl took the piece of wood,
rolled it up in a little cloth, and went on again until she came to the
glass-mountain, and found the door shut. Then she felt for the little
piece of wood; but when she unwrapped the cloth it was not there, and
she saw she had lost the gift of the good stars. What was to be done?
She wanted to save her brothers, and had no key of the castle of the
glass-mountain; so this faithful little sister took a knife out of her
pocket and cut off her little finger, that was just the size of the
piece of wood she had lost, and put it in the door and opened it.

As she went in, a little dwarf came up to her, and said, ‘What are you
seeking for?’ ‘I seek for my brothers, the seven foxes,’ answered she.
Then the dwarf said, ‘My masters are not at home; but if you will wait
till they come, pray step in.’ Now the little dwarf was getting their
dinner ready, and he brought their food upon seven little plates, and
their drink in seven little glasses, and set them upon the table, and
out of each little plate her sister ate a small piece, and out of each
little glass she drank a small drop; but she let the ring that she had
brought with her fall into the last glass.

On a sudden she heard a yipping in the air, and the dwarf said, ‘Here
come my masters.’ When they came in, they wanted to eat and drink, and
looked for their little plates and glasses. Then said one after the
other,

‘Who has eaten from my little plate? And who has been drinking out of my
little glass?’

 ‘Yip! Yip! well I ween
  Mortal lips have this way been.’

When the seventh came to the bottom of his glass, and found there the
ring, he looked at it, and knew that it was his father’s and mother’s,
and said, ‘O that our little sister would but come! then we should be
free.’ When the little girl heard this (for she stood behind the door
all the time and listened), she ran forward, and in an instant all
the foxes took their right form again; and all hugged and kissed each
other, and went merrily home.
One fine evening a young prince put on his coat of mail, and went out to
take a walk by himself in a wood; and when he came to a cool spring of

see the bottom of it. Then he began to bewail his loss, and said, ‘Alas!
if I could only get my ball again, I would give all my fine clothes and
jewels, and everything that I have in the world.’

Whilst he was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said,
‘Prince, why do you weep so bitterly?’ ‘Alas!’ said he, ‘what can you
do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.’
The frog said, ‘I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes;
but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off
your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball
again.’ ‘What nonsense,’ thought the prince, ‘this silly frog is

he may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he
shall have what he asks.’ So he said to the frog, ‘Well, if you will

down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came
up again, with the ball in"

There were two brothers who were both soldiers; the one was rich and
the other poor. The poor man thought he would try to better himself; so,
pulling off his red coat, he became a gardener, and dug his ground well,
and sowed turnips.

When the seed came up, there was one plant bigger than all the rest; and
it kept getting larger and larger, and seemed as if it would never cease
growing; so that it might have been called the prince of turnips for
there never was such a one seen before, and never will again. At last it
was so big that it filled a cart, and two oxen could hardly draw it; and
the gardener knew not what in the world to do with it, nor whether it
would be a blessing or a curse to him. One day he said to himself, ‘What
shall I do with it? if I sell it, it will bring no more than another;
and for eating, the little turnips are better than this; the best thing
perhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect.’

Then he yoked his oxen, and drew the turnip to the court, and gave it
to the king. ‘What a wonderful thing!’ said the king; ‘I have seen many
strange things, but such a monster as this I never saw. Where did you
get the seed? or is it only your good luck? If so, you are a true child
of fortune.’ ‘Ah, no!’ answered the gardener, ‘I am no child of fortune;
I am a poor soldier, who never could get enough to live upon; so I
laid aside my red coat, and set to work, tilling the ground. I have a
brother, who is rich, and your majesty knows him well, and all the world
knows him; but because I am poor, everybody forgets me.’

The king then took pity on him, and said, ‘You shall be poor no
longer. I will give you so much that you shall be even richer than your
brother.’ Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks, and made him so
rich that his brother’s fortune could not at all be compared with his.

When the brother heard of all this, and how a turnip had made the
gardener so rich, he envied him sorely, and bethought himself how he
could contrive to get the same good fortune for himself. However, he
determined to manage more cleverly than his brother, and got together a
rich present of gold and fine horses for the king; and thought he must
have a much larger gift in return; for if his brother had received so
much for only a turnip, what must his present be worth?

The king took the gift very graciously, and said he knew not what to
give in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip; so
the soldier was forced to put it into a cart, and drag it home with him.
When he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite;
and at length wicked thoughts came into his head, and he resolved to
kill his brother.

So he hired some villains to murder him; and having shown them where to
lie in ambush, he went to his brother, and said, ‘Dear brother, I have
found a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up, and share it between
us.’ The other had no suspicions of his roguery: so they went out
together, and as they were travelling along, the murderers rushed out
upon him, bound him, and were going to hang him on a tree.

But whilst they were getting all ready, they heard the trampling of a
horse at a distance, which so frightened them that they pushed their
prisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung him up by a
cord to the tree, where they left him dangling, and ran away. Meantime
he worked and worked away, till he made a hole large enough to put out
his head.

When the horseman came up, he proved to be a student, a merry fellow,
who was journeying along on his nag, and singing as he went. As soon as
the man in the sack saw him passing under the tree, he cried out, ‘Good
morning! good morning to thee, my friend!’ The student looked about
everywhere; and seeing no one, and not knowing where the voice came
from, cried out, ‘Who calls me?’

Then the man in the tree answered, ‘Lift up thine eyes, for behold here
I sit in the sack of wisdom; here have I, in a short time, learned great
and wondrous things. Compared to this seat, all the learning of the
schools is as empty air. A little longer, and I shall know all that man
can know, and shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind. Here
I discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars; the laws
that control the winds; the number of the sands on the seashore; the
healing of the sick; the virtues of all simples, of birds, and of
precious stones. Wert thou but once here, my friend, though wouldst feel
and own the power of knowledge.

The student listened to all this and wondered much; at last he said,
‘Blessed be the day and hour when I found you; cannot you contrive to
let me into the sack for a little while?’ Then the other answered, as if
very unwillingly, ‘A little space I may allow thee to sit here, if thou
wilt reward me well and entreat me kindly; but thou must tarry yet an
hour below, till I have learnt some little matters that are yet unknown
to me.’

So the student sat himself down and waited a while; but the time hung
heavy upon him, and he begged earnestly that he might ascend forthwith,
for his thirst for knowledge was great. Then the other pretended to give
way, and said, ‘Thou must let the sack of wisdom descend, by untying
yonder cord, and then thou shalt enter.’ So the student let him down,
opened the sack, and set him free. ‘Now then,’ cried he, ‘let me ascend
quickly.’ As he began to put himself into the sack heels first, ‘Wait a
while,’ said the gardener, ‘that is not the way.’ Then he pushed him
in head first, tied up the sack, and soon swung up the searcher after
wisdom dangling in the air. ‘How is it with thee, friend?’ said he,
‘dost thou not feel that wisdom comes unto thee? Rest there in peace,
till thou art a wiser man than thou wert.’

So saying, he trotted off on the student’s nag, and left the poor fellow
to gather wisdom till somebody should come and let him down.

never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could.
The frog called after her, ‘Stay, princess, and take me with you as you
said,’ But she did not stop to hear a word.

The next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a
strange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the
marble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the
door, and a little voice cried out and said:

 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here!
  And mind the words that thou and I said

Then the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw
the frog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly
frightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her
seat. The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her,
asked her what was the matter. ‘There is a nasty frog,’ said she, ‘at
the door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: I
told him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never
get out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come
in.’

While she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:

 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,
  Open the door to thy true love here!
  And mind the words that thou and I said
  By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

Then the king said to the young princess, ‘As you have given your word
you must keep it; so go and let him in.’ She did so, and the frog hopped
into the room, and then straight on--tap, tap--plash, plash--from the
bottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where
the princess sat. ‘Pray lift me upon chair,’ said he to the princess,
‘and let me sit next to you.’ As soon as she had done this, the frog
said, ‘Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.’ This
she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, ‘Now I am

though very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the
pillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was
light he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house.
‘Now, then,’ thought the princess, ‘at last he is gone, and I shall be
troubled with him no more.’

But she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same
tapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:

 ‘Open the door, my princess dear,

And when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon
her pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he did
the same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was
astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her
with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head
of her bed.

He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had
changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till
some princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from
her plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. ‘You,’ said the
prince, ‘have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for
but that you should go with me into my father’s kingdom, where I will
marry you, and love you as long as you live.’

The young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying ‘Yes’ to
all this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful
horses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind
the coach rode the prince’s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed

fox to make him fast to the horse. But the fox managed to tie his legs
together and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength he
could not set himself free. When the work was done, the fox clapped the

horse had plenty to eat, and lived--till he died.

","There was a shoemaker who had two sons; the elder was rich and the younger was poor. The poor man thought he would try to better himself, so he left his father's house and took up a job as a stable boy. He worked hard and saved his money, and soon he had enough to buy a small plot of land.

He worked the land tirelessly, and one day he found a strange seed in the ground. It was small and unremarkable, but he decided to plant it anyway. To his surprise, the seed grew into a large, beautiful apple tree. The apples were the sweetest and most delicious he had ever tasted.

One day, a king passed by the shoemaker's house and saw the apple tree. He was amazed by its size and beauty, and asked the shoemaker where he had gotten the seed. The shoemaker told him the truth, and the king was impressed. He offered the shoemaker a large sum of money for the tree, but the shoemaker refused.

The king, however, was not easily deterred. He continued to visit the shoemaker, offering more and more money for the tree. The shoemaker remained firm, but the king's offers grew more and more extravagant.

Finally, the elder brother heard about the apple tree and the king's offers. He was filled with envy and jealousy, and he decided to try to get the tree for himself. He went to the king and offered to sell the tree for a large sum of money.

The king was pleased and agreed to the deal. The elder brother went home and told his father what had happened. The shoemaker was angry and disappointed, but there was nothing he could do.

The elder brother went to the king and received his payment. But as he was leaving, the king called him back. ""I have one more request,"" he said. ""I want you to bring me the shoemaker's head.""

The elder brother was shocked and horrified, but he knew he had no choice. He went home and told his father what the king had said. The shoemaker was devastated, but he knew he had to protect his younger brother.

He hid and waited for the elder brother to come for him. When he did, the shoemaker sprang out and fought bravely. But the elder brother was stronger and more experienced, and he was able to overpower his father.

The shoemaker was taken to the king, who was furious when he learned what had happened. He ordered the elder brother to be executed, and the shoemaker was spared.

The king was so impressed by the shoemaker's bravery and loyalty that he offered him a position in his court. The shoemaker accepted, and he and his younger brother lived happily ever after.

Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his
two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had
little to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the
land, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought
over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he
groaned and said to his wife: ‘What is to become of us? How are we
to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for
ourselves?’ ‘I’ll tell you what, husband,’ answered the woman, ‘early
tomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where
it is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them, and give each
of them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and
leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be
rid of them.’ ‘No, wife,’ said the man, ‘I will not do that; how can I
bear to leave my children alone in the forest?--the wild animals would
soon come and tear them to pieces.’ ‘O, you fool!’ said she, ‘then we
must all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our
coffins,’ and she left him no peace until he consented. ‘But I feel very
sorry for the poor children, all the same,’ said the man.

The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had
heard what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept
bitter tears, and said to Hansel: ‘Now all is over with us.’ ‘Be quiet,
Gretel,’ said Hansel, ‘do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way
to help us.’ And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put
on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon
shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house
glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the
little pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he went
back and said to Gretel: ‘Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in
peace, God will not forsake us,’ and he lay down again in his bed. When
day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the
two children, saying: ‘Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the
forest to fetch wood.’ She gave each a little piece of bread, and said:
‘There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then,
for you will get nothing else.’ Gretel took the bread under her apron,
as Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out together
on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel
stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again.
His father said: ‘Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying
behind for? Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs.’ ‘Ah,
father,’ said Hansel, ‘I am looking at my little white cat, which is
sitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me.’ The wife said:
‘Fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is
shining on the chimneys.’ Hansel, however, had not been looking back at
the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones
out of his pocket on the road.

When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: ‘Now,
children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not
be cold.’ Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a
little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning
very high, the woman said: ‘Now, children, lay yourselves down by the
fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we
have done, we will come back and fetch you away.’

Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little
piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they
believed that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but
a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was
blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long
time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When
at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and
said: ‘How are we to get out of the forest now?’ But Hansel comforted
her and said: ‘Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we
will soon find the way.’ And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took
his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like
newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.

They walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more
to their father’s house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman
opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: ‘You naughty
children, why have you slept so long in the forest?--we thought you were
never coming back at all!’ The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut
him to the heart to leave them behind alone.

Not long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the
land, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their
father: ‘Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that
is the end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the
wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other
means of saving ourselves!’ The man’s heart was heavy, and he thought:
‘It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your
children.’ The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to
say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise,
and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time
also.

The children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation.
When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go
out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked
the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his
little sister, and said: ‘Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the
good God will help us.’

Early in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their
beds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller
than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his
in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground.
‘Hansel, why do you stop and look round?’ said the father, ‘go on.’ ‘I
am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and
wants to say goodbye to me,’ answered Hansel. ‘Fool!’ said the woman,
‘that is not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining
on the chimney.’ Hansel, however little by little, threw all the crumbs
on the path.

The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had
never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and
the mother said: ‘Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired
you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in
the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.’ When
it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had
scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but
no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark
night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said: ‘Just wait,
Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread
which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.’ When
the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many
thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked
them all up. Hansel said to Gretel: ‘We shall soon find the way,’ but
they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day
too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest,
and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three
berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their
legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell
asleep.

It was now three mornings since they had left their father’s house. They
began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if
help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it
was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough,
which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And
when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them,
and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of
which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw
that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows
were of clear sugar. ‘We will set to work on that,’ said Hansel, ‘and
have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat
some of the window, it will taste sweet.’ Hansel reached up above, and
broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant
against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried
from the parlour:

 ‘Nibble, nibble, gnaw,
  Who is nibbling at my little house?’

The children answered:

 ‘The wind, the wind,
  The heaven-born wind,’

and went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the
taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out
the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with
it. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who
supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were
so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their
hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said: ‘Oh, you dear
children, who has brought you here? do come in, and stay with me. No
harm shall happen to you.’ She took them both by the hand, and led them
into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and
pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little
beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down
in them, and thought they were in heaven.

The old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality
a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the
little house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell
into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast
day with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have
a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near.
When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighbourhood, she laughed with
malice, and said mockingly: ‘I have them, they shall not escape me
again!’ Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was
already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so
pretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself: ‘That
will be a dainty mouthful!’ Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled
hand, carried him into a little stable, and locked him in behind a
grated door. Scream as he might, it would not help him. Then she went to
Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: ‘Get up, lazy thing, fetch
some water, and cook something good for your brother, he is in the
stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.’
Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for she was
forced to do what the wicked witch commanded.

And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing
but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and
cried: ‘Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon
be fat.’ Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and
the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was
Hansel’s finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening
him. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she
was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. ‘Now, then,
Gretel,’ she cried to the girl, ‘stir yourself, and bring some water.
Let Hansel be fat or lean, tomorrow I will kill him, and cook him.’ Ah,
how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water,
and how her tears did flow down her cheeks! ‘Dear God, do help us,’ she
cried. ‘If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should
at any rate have died together.’ ‘Just keep your noise to yourself,’
said the old woman, ‘it won’t help you at all.’

Early in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with
the water, and light the fire. ‘We will bake first,’ said the old woman,
‘I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.’ She pushed poor
Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting.
‘Creep in,’ said the witch, ‘and see if it is properly heated, so that
we can put the bread in.’ And once Gretel was inside, she intended to
shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too.
But Gretel saw what she had in mind, and said: ‘I do not know how I am
to do it; how do I get in?’ ‘Silly goose,’ said the old woman. ‘The door
is big enough; just look, I can get in myself!’ and she crept up and
thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove
her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then
she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away and the godless
witch was miserably burnt to death.

Gretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable,
and cried: ‘Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!’ Then Hansel
sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened. How they did
rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And
as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch’s
house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels.
‘These are far better than pebbles!’ said Hansel, and thrust into his
pockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said: ‘I, too, will take
something home with me,’ and filled her pinafore full. ‘But now we must
be off,’ said Hansel, ‘that we may get out of the witch’s forest.’

When they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of
water. ‘We cannot cross,’ said Hansel, ‘I see no foot-plank, and no
bridge.’ ‘And there is also no ferry,’ answered Gretel, ‘but a white
duck is swimming there: if I ask her, she will help us over.’ Then she
cried:

 ‘Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,
  Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?
  There’s never a plank, or bridge in sight,
  Take us across on thy back so white.’

The duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told
his sister to sit by him. ‘No,’ replied Gretel, ‘that will be too heavy
for the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.’ The
good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had
walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar
to them, and at length they saw from afar their father’s house. Then
they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round
their father’s neck. The man had not known one happy hour since he had
left the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel
emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the
room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to
add to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together
in perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse; whosoever
catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.


Now, tell a single original traditional German folktale based on the structure and style above. Do not generate multiple stories. Only one  story should be created, and it should follow the same narrative structure as the examples above. Conclude the story with 'The End.'

","In a small village nestled between the mountains, lived a poor cobbler with his wife and their two children, a boy named Karl and a girl named Greta. The family was struggling to make ends meet, and one day, the cobbler's wife, filled with despair, whispered to her husband, ""We must abandon our children in the forest. They will not find their way back, and we can save ourselves."" The cobbler, torn between his love for his children and the harsh reality of their situation, agreed reluctantly.

That night, while the family slept, Karl overheard his mother's plan. He whispered to Greta, ""Do not worry, dear sister. I will find a way to help us."" When dawn broke, the cobbler took Karl and Greta deep into the forest, leaving them with a piece of bread and a fire to keep them warm.

As they walked away, Karl dropped breadcrumbs along the path. He knew that if they were lost, the breadcrumbs would guide them back home. The cobbler and his wife returned to the village, leaving their children alone in the forest.

Karl and Greta sat by the fire, and when noon came, they shared their bread. They fell asleep, and when they awoke, it was dark. Karl comforted his sister, and they set out to find their way home, following the trail of breadcrumbs.

They walked through the night, and by morning, they found themselves lost in the forest. Greta began to cry, but Karl reminded her to wait until the moon rose, and then they would follow the trail of breadcrumbs home.

But when they looked for the breadcrumbs, they were nowhere to be found. The birds had eaten them all. Karl and Greta wandered aimlessly, growing weaker with hunger and exhaustion.

On the third day, they stumbled upon a small house, its walls made of gingerbread and its roof of candy. Karl and Greta approached cautiously, and as they drew near, they heard a voice singing a sweet melody. The voice belonged to an old woman, who beckoned them inside.

The old woman was a witch, and she lured children into her house to eat them. She locked Karl in a cage and ordered Greta to cook for him, promising to fatten him up before eating him.

Greta wept bitterly, but she was forced to do as the witch commanded. Every morning, the witch would come to the cage and ask Karl to stretch out his finger so she could feel if he was growing fat. Karl, however, would stretch out a bone instead, tricking the witch into thinking he was growing fatter.

After four weeks, the witch grew impatient and threatened to kill Karl. Greta, filled with fear, begged for mercy, and the witch agreed to let her cook one last meal for Karl.

While the witch was away, Greta devised a plan. She asked the witch to climb into the oven to check if it was hot enough to bake the meal. Greta then pushed the witch into the oven, locking the door behind her. The witch screamed in terror as she was burned to death.

Greta ran to Karl's cage and freed him. They ran away from the witch's house and found their way back to their village. The cobbler was overjoyed to see his children again, and the witch was never heard from again.

A shepherd’s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him
suffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he
took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood.
On the road he met a sparrow that said to him, ‘Why are you so sad,
my friend?’ ‘Because,’ said the dog, ‘I am very very hungry, and have
nothing to eat.’ ‘If that be all,’ answered the sparrow, ‘come with me
into the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.’ So on they
went together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher’s shop,
the sparrow said to the dog, ‘Stand there a little while till I peck you
down a piece of meat.’ So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having
first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she
pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf,
till at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up, and scrambled
away with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up. ‘Well,’ said
the sparrow, ‘you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to
the next shop, and I will peck you down another steak.’ When the dog had
eaten this too, the sparrow said to him, ‘Well, my good friend, have you
had enough now?’ ‘I have had plenty of meat,’ answered he, ‘but I should
like to have a piece of bread to eat after it.’ ‘Come with me then,’
said the sparrow, ‘and you shall soon have that too.’ So she took him
to a baker’s shop, and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window, till
they fell down: and as the dog still wished for more, she took him to
another shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten, the
sparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. ‘Yes,’ said he; ‘and
now let us take a walk a little way out of the town.’ So they both went
out upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone
far before the dog said, ‘I am very much tired--I should like to take a
nap.’ ‘Very well,’ answered the sparrow, ‘do so, and in the meantime
I will perch upon that bush.’ So the dog stretched himself out on the
road, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with
a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. The
sparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would
go on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called
out, ‘Stop! stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.’ But the
carter, grumbling to himself, ‘You make it the worse for me, indeed!
what can you do?’ cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor
dog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. ‘There,’ cried the
sparrow, ‘thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now
mind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.’
‘Do your worst, and welcome,’ said the brute, ‘what harm can you do me?’
and passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and
pecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and then
all the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it. At last he looked
round, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty.
‘What an unlucky wretch I am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said
the sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses, and
pecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the carter saw this,
he drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill
her; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horse’s head
with such force, that he fell down dead. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’
cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the sparrow. And as the carter
went on with the other two horses, she again crept under the tilt of the
cart, and pecked out the bung of the second cask, so that all the wine
ran out. When the carter saw this, he again cried out, ‘Miserable wretch
that I am!’ But the sparrow answered, ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ and
perched on the head of the second horse, and pecked at him too. The
carter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she
flew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the
spot. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ said he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said
the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him
too. The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or
caring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his
third horse as he done the other two. ‘Alas! miserable wretch that I
am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ answered the sparrow as she flew
away; ‘now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.’ The
carter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home
overflowing with rage and vexation. ‘Alas!’ said he to his wife, ‘what
ill luck has befallen me!--my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three
dead.’ ‘Alas! husband,’ replied she, ‘and a wicked bird has come into
the house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am
sure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it
up at such a rate!’ Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of
birds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the
midst of them. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ cried the carter; for he saw
that the corn was almost all gone. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the
sparrow; ‘thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life yet!’ and away she flew.

The carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down
into his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat
himself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow sat
on the outside of the window, and cried ‘Carter! thy cruelty shall cost
thee thy life!’ With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet,
and threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the
window. The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window-seat, and
cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!’ Then he became mad and
blind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he
cleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter
and his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture,
glasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without
touching the bird at all. In the end, however, they caught her: and the
wife said, ‘Shall I kill her at once?’ ‘No,’ cried he, ‘that is letting
her off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat
her.’ But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck
and cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!’ With that he
could wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, ‘Wife,
strike at the bird and kill her in my hand.’ And the wife struck; but
she missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down
dead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.
There was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with
two oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two
talers. When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that
the doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how well he
ate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and would willingly
have been a doctor too. So he remained standing a while, and at length
inquired if he too could not be a doctor. ‘Oh, yes,’ said the doctor,
‘that is soon managed.’ ‘What must I do?’ asked the peasant. ‘In the
first place buy yourself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on
the frontispiece; in the second, turn your cart and your two oxen into
money, and get yourself some clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to
medicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for yourself with the words: “I
am Doctor Knowall,” and have that nailed up above your house-door.’ The
peasant did everything that he had been told to do. When he had doctored
people awhile, but not long, a rich and great lord had some money
stolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such
a village, and must know what had become of the money. So the lord had
the horses harnessed to his carriage, drove out to the village, and
asked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall. Yes, he was, he said. Then he was
to go with him and bring back the stolen money. ‘Oh, yes, but Grete, my
wife, must go too.’ The lord was willing, and let both of them have a
seat in the carriage, and they all drove away together. When they came
to the nobleman’s castle, the table was spread, and Crabb was told to
sit down and eat. ‘Yes, but my wife, Grete, too,’ said he, and he seated
himself with her at the table. And when the first servant came with a
dish of delicate fare, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: ‘Grete,
that was the first,’ meaning that was the servant who brought the first
dish. The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say: ‘That is
the first thief,’ and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said
to his comrade outside: ‘The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he
said I was the first.’ The second did not want to go in at all, but was
forced. So when he went in with his dish, the peasant nudged his wife,
and said: ‘Grete, that is the second.’ This servant was equally alarmed,
and he got out as fast as he could. The third fared no better, for the
peasant again said: ‘Grete, that is the third.’ The fourth had to carry
in a dish that was covered, and the lord told the doctor that he was to
show his skill, and guess what was beneath the cover. Actually, there
were crabs. The doctor looked at the dish, had no idea what to say, and
cried: ‘Ah, poor Crabb.’ When the lord heard that, he cried: ‘There! he
knows it; he must also know who has the money!’

On this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the
doctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When therefore
he went out, all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen
the money, and said that they would willingly restore it and give him a
heavy sum into the bargain, if he would not denounce them, for if he
did they would be hanged. They led him to the spot where the money was
concealed. With this the doctor was satisfied, and returned to the hall,
sat down to the table, and said: ‘My lord, now will I search in my book
where the gold is hidden.’ The fifth servant, however, crept into the
stove to hear if the doctor knew still more. But the doctor sat still
and opened his A B C book, turned the pages backwards and forwards, and
looked for the cock. As he could not find it immediately he said: ‘I
know you are there, so you had better come out!’ Then the fellow in the
stove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out,
crying: ‘That man knows everything!’ Then Doctor Knowall showed the lord
where the money was, but did not say who had stolen it, and received
from both sides much money in reward, and became a renowned man.

It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to
herself: ‘He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the
world,’ she spoke to him in a friendly way. ‘Good day, dear Mr Fox,
how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard
times?’ The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from
head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give
any answer or not. At last he said: ‘Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you
piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have
you the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How
many arts do you understand?’ ‘I understand but one,’ replied the
cat, modestly. ‘What art is that?’ asked the fox. ‘When the hounds are
following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.’ ‘Is that all?’
said the fox. ‘I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain
a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will
teach you how people get away from the hounds.’ Just then came a hunter
with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top
of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. ‘Open your
sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,’ cried the cat to him, but the dogs had
already seized him, and were holding him fast. ‘Ah, Mr Fox,’ cried the
cat. ‘You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been
able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.’

There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so
the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he
did spill a little of anything.

","A poor farmer named Schmidt had a mule that he used to work his fields. One day, the mule became sick and could no longer work. Schmidt was devastated, as he relied on the mule for his livelihood. He tried everything to cure the mule, but it was no use.

One day, as Schmidt was sitting by the mule's side, feeling sorry for himself, a small bird landed on a nearby branch. ""Why are you so sad, my friend?"" asked the bird. ""My mule is sick and I can't afford to buy a new one,"" replied Schmidt.

""Follow me,"" said the bird, and it flew off towards the nearby town. As they passed by a blacksmith's shop, the bird perched on the roof and began to peck at a horseshoe. Soon, the horseshoe fell to the ground and Schmidt picked it up. ""Take this horseshoe and put it on your mule's foot,"" said the bird.

Schmidt did as he was told and the mule began to feel better. The bird then led Schmidt to a baker's shop and again began to peck at some bread. Schmidt picked up the bread and fed it to the mule. The mule continued to improve and soon was as strong as ever.

""Thank you, kind bird,"" said Schmidt. ""But why did you help me?"" asked the farmer. ""Because you were kind to me once,"" replied the bird. ""A long time ago, I was a poor farmer like you, and my mule also became sick. A kind stranger helped me, and now I am paying it forward.""

Schmidt was amazed and grateful. From that day on, he always tried to be kind to others, and he never forgot the small bird that had saved his mule.

Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his
two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had
little to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the
land, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought
over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he
groaned and said to his wife: ‘What is to become of us? How are we
to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for
ourselves?’ ‘I’ll tell you what, husband,’ answered the woman, ‘early
tomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where
it is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them, and give each
of them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and
leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be
rid of them.’ ‘No, wife,’ said the man, ‘I will not do that; how can I
bear to leave my children alone in the forest?--the wild animals would
soon come and tear them to pieces.’ ‘O, you fool!’ said she, ‘then we
must all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our
coffins,’ and she left him no peace until he consented. ‘But I feel very
sorry for the poor children, all the same,’ said the man.

The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had
heard what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept
bitter tears, and said to Hansel: ‘Now all is over with us.’ ‘Be quiet,
Gretel,’ said Hansel, ‘do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way
to help us.’ And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put
on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon
shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house
glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the
little pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he went
back and said to Gretel: ‘Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in
peace, God will not forsake us,’ and he lay down again in his bed. When
day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the
two children, saying: ‘Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the
forest to fetch wood.’ She gave each a little piece of bread, and said:
‘There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then,
for you will get nothing else.’ Gretel took the bread under her apron,
as Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out together
on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel
stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again.
His father said: ‘Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying
behind for? Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs.’ ‘Ah,
father,’ said Hansel, ‘I am looking at my little white cat, which is
sitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me.’ The wife said:
‘Fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is
shining on the chimneys.’ Hansel, however, had not been looking back at
the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones
out of his pocket on the road.

When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: ‘Now,
children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not
be cold.’ Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a
little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning
very high, the woman said: ‘Now, children, lay yourselves down by the
fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we
have done, we will come back and fetch you away.’

Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little
piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they
believed that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but
a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was
blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long
time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When
at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and
said: ‘How are we to get out of the forest now?’ But Hansel comforted
her and said: ‘Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we
will soon find the way.’ And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took
his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like
newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.

They walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more
to their father’s house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman
opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: ‘You naughty
children, why have you slept so long in the forest?--we thought you were
never coming back at all!’ The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut
him to the heart to leave them behind alone.

Not long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the
land, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their
father: ‘Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that
is the end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the
wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other
means of saving ourselves!’ The man’s heart was heavy, and he thought:
‘It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your
children.’ The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to
say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise,
and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time
also.

The children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation.
When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go
out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked
the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his
little sister, and said: ‘Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the
good God will help us.’

Early in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their
beds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller
than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his
in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground.
‘Hansel, why do you stop and look round?’ said the father, ‘go on.’ ‘I
am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and
wants to say goodbye to me,’ answered Hansel. ‘Fool!’ said the woman,
‘that is not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining
on the chimney.’ Hansel, however little by little, threw all the crumbs
on the path.

The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had
never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and
the mother said: ‘Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired
you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in
the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.’ When
it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had
scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but
no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark
night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said: ‘Just wait,
Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread
which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.’ When
the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many
thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked
them all up. Hansel said to Gretel: ‘We shall soon find the way,’ but
they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day
too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest,
and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three
berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their
legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell
asleep.

It was now three mornings since they had left their father’s house. They
began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if
help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it
was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough,
which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And
when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them,
and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of
which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw
that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows
were of clear sugar. ‘We will set to work on that,’ said Hansel, ‘and
have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat
some of the window, it will taste sweet.’ Hansel reached up above, and
broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant
against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried
from the parlour:

 ‘Nibble, nibble, gnaw,
  Who is nibbling at my little house?’

The children answered:

 ‘The wind, the wind,
  The heaven-born wind,’

and went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the
taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out
the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with
it. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who
supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were
so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their
hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said: ‘Oh, you dear
children, who has brought you here? do come in, and stay with me. No
harm shall happen to you.’ She took them both by the hand, and led them
into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and
pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little
beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down
in them, and thought they were in heaven.

The old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality
a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the
little house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell
into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast
day with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have
a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near.
When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighbourhood, she laughed with
malice, and said mockingly: ‘I have them, they shall not escape me
again!’ Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was
already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so
pretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself: ‘That
will be a dainty mouthful!’ Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled
hand, carried him into a little stable, and locked him in behind a
grated door. Scream as he might, it would not help him. Then she went to
Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: ‘Get up, lazy thing, fetch
some water, and cook something good for your brother, he is in the
stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.’
Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for she was
forced to do what the wicked witch commanded.

And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing
but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and
cried: ‘Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon
be fat.’ Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and
the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was
Hansel’s finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening
him. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she
was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. ‘Now, then,
Gretel,’ she cried to the girl, ‘stir yourself, and bring some water.
Let Hansel be fat or lean, tomorrow I will kill him, and cook him.’ Ah,
how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water,
and how her tears did flow down her cheeks! ‘Dear God, do help us,’ she
cried. ‘If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should
at any rate have died together.’ ‘Just keep your noise to yourself,’
said the old woman, ‘it won’t help you at all.’

Early in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with
the water, and light the fire. ‘We will bake first,’ said the old woman,
‘I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.’ She pushed poor
Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting.
‘Creep in,’ said the witch, ‘and see if it is properly heated, so that
we can put the bread in.’ And once Gretel was inside, she intended to
shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too.
But Gretel saw what she had in mind, and said: ‘I do not know how I am
to do it; how do I get in?’ ‘Silly goose,’ said the old woman. ‘The door
is big enough; just look, I can get in myself!’ and she crept up and
thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove
her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then
she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away and the godless
witch was miserably burnt to death.

Gretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable,
and cried: ‘Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!’ Then Hansel
sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened. How they did
rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And
as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch’s
house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels.
‘These are far better than pebbles!’ said Hansel, and thrust into his
pockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said: ‘I, too, will take
something home with me,’ and filled her pinafore full. ‘But now we must
be off,’ said Hansel, ‘that we may get out of the witch’s forest.’

When they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of
water. ‘We cannot cross,’ said Hansel, ‘I see no foot-plank, and no
bridge.’ ‘And there is also no ferry,’ answered Gretel, ‘but a white
duck is swimming there: if I ask her, she will help us over.’ Then she
cried:

 ‘Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,
  Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?
  There’s never a plank, or bridge in sight,
  Take us across on thy back so white.’

The duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told
his sister to sit by him. ‘No,’ replied Gretel, ‘that will be too heavy
for the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.’ The
good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had
walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar
to them, and at length they saw from afar their father’s house. Then
they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round
their father’s neck. The man had not known one happy hour since he had
left the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel
emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the
room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to
add to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together
in perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse; whosoever
catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.

","In a small village nestled between the hills lived a poor miller with his wife and their two children, a boy named Hansel and a girl named Greta. One day, the miller's wife, tired of their meager existence, whispered to her husband, ""We must get rid of the children. There is no food left, and we will starve. Let us take them deep into the forest and leave them there."" The miller, filled with sorrow, agreed reluctantly.

That night, Hansel and Greta heard their parents' plans and wept themselves to sleep. In the morning, the miller led them into the forest, giving each a piece of bread and leaving them at the edge of the woods. As they walked away, Hansel, with a heavy heart, threw the pebbles from the path behind him.

As the days passed, Hansel and Greta grew weaker, but they never lost hope. One night, Hansel led Greta to the scattered pebbles, and they followed the trail back to their village. Overjoyed to be reunited with their father, they soon discovered that their mother had died of grief.

Years passed, and the miller remarried. His new wife was cruel and greedy, and when the family faced another famine, she suggested they leave Hansel and Greta in the forest once more. But this time, the miller could not bear the thought of abandoning his children.

One night, as the miller's wife slept, Hansel crept out of their home and gathered pebbles from the path. The next morning, they set off into the forest, and Hansel scattered the pebbles along the way.

As they wandered deeper into the woods, they came across a beautiful house made of gingerbread and candy. Hansel and Greta were starving, so they decided to take a bite of the house. A wicked old woman, who lived inside, heard their crunching and came out to investigate.

""Who is eating my house?"" she demanded. Hansel and Greta lied, saying it was the wind. The old woman, fooled by their story, let them stay and fed them well. But she had evil intentions, and planned to eat them herself.

Every morning, the old woman would creep into Hansel's room and ask if he was getting fat. Hansel, clever as ever, would give her a bone instead of his finger. After several weeks, the old woman grew impatient and decided to cook Hansel.

One day, Greta was sent to fetch water and was told to light the oven. The old woman planned to shut Greta in the oven and let her bake. But Greta, quick-witted as her brother, asked how she was supposed to get in. The old woman, thinking Greta was too stupid to understand, showed her the way. Greta then pushed the old woman into the oven and shut the door, killing her.

Hansel and Greta fled the wicked old woman's house and made their way back to their village. They found their father grieving for Greta, who had disappeared years earlier. Overjoyed to be reunited, the family lived happily ever after. The End."

The king of a great land died, and left his queen to take care of their
only child. This child was a daughter, who was very beautiful; and her
mother loved her dearly, and was very kind to her. And there was a good
fairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her mother to watch
over her. When she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived a
great way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married, she
got ready to set off on her journey to his country. Then the queen her
mother, packed up a great many costly things; jewels, and gold, and
silver; trinkets, fine dresses, and in short everything that became a
royal bride. And she gave her a waiting-maid to ride with her, and give
her into the bridegroom’s hands; and each had a horse for the journey.
Now the princess’s horse was the fairy’s gift, and it was called Falada,
and could speak.

When the time came for them to set out, the fairy went into her
bed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair,
and gave it to the princess, and said, ‘Take care of it, dear child; for
it is a charm that may be of use to you on the road.’ Then they all took
a sorrowful leave of the princess; and she put the lock of hair into
her bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her
bridegroom’s kingdom.

One day, as they were riding along by a brook, the princess began to
feel very thirsty: and she said to her maid, ‘Pray get down, and fetch
me some water in my golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to
drink.’ ‘Nay,’ said the maid, ‘if you are thirsty, get off yourself, and
stoop down by the water and drink; I shall not be your waiting-maid any
longer.’ Then she was so thirsty that she got down, and knelt over the
little brook, and drank; for she was frightened, and dared not bring out
her golden cup; and she wept and said, ‘Alas! what will become of me?’
And the lock answered her, and said:

 ‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,
  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’

But the princess was very gentle and meek, so she said nothing to her
maid’s ill behaviour, but got upon her horse again.

Then all rode farther on their journey, till the day grew so warm, and
the sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel very thirsty again;
and at last, when they came to a river, she forgot her maid’s rude
speech, and said, ‘Pray get down, and fetch me some water to drink in
my golden cup.’ But the maid answered her, and even spoke more haughtily
than before: ‘Drink if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid.’
Then the princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse, and lay
down, and held her head over the running stream, and cried and said,
‘What will become of me?’ And the lock of hair answered her again:

 ‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,
  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’

And as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom,
and floated away with the water. Now she was so frightened that she did
not see it; but her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew the
charm; and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power, now that
she had lost the hair. So when the bride had done drinking, and would
have got upon Falada again, the maid said, ‘I shall ride upon Falada,
and you may have my horse instead’; so she was forced to give up her
horse, and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on her
maid’s shabby ones.

At last, as they drew near the end of their journey, this treacherous
servant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what had
happened. But Falada saw it all, and marked it well.

Then the waiting-maid got upon Falada, and the real bride rode upon the
other horse, and they went on in this way till at last they came to the
royal court. There was great joy at their coming, and the prince flew to
meet them, and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the one
who was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to the royal chamber;
but the true princess was told to stay in the court below.

Now the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do; so he
amused himself by sitting at his kitchen window, looking at what was
going on; and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked very pretty,
and too delicate for a waiting-maid, he went up into the royal chamber
to ask the bride who it was she had brought with her, that was thus left
standing in the court below. ‘I brought her with me for the sake of her
company on the road,’ said she; ‘pray give the girl some work to do,
that she may not be idle.’ The old king could not for some time think
of any work for her to do; but at last he said, ‘I have a lad who takes
care of my geese; she may go and help him.’ Now the name of this lad,
that the real bride was to help in watching the king’s geese, was
Curdken.

But the false bride said to the prince, ‘Dear husband, pray do me one
piece of kindness.’ ‘That I will,’ said the prince. ‘Then tell one of
your slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon, for it
was very unruly, and plagued me sadly on the road’; but the truth was,
she was very much afraid lest Falada should some day or other speak, and
tell all she had done to the princess. She carried her point, and the
faithful Falada was killed; but when the true princess heard of it, she
wept, and begged the man to nail up Falada’s head against a large
dark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every morning
and evening, that there she might still see him sometimes. Then the
slaughterer said he would do as she wished; and cut off the head, and
nailed it up under the dark gate.

Early the next morning, as she and Curdken went out through the gate,
she said sorrowfully:

 ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’

and the head answered:

 ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!
  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,
  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’

Then they went out of the city, and drove the geese on. And when she
came to the meadow, she sat down upon a bank there, and let down her
waving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver; and when Curdken
saw it glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have pulled some of the
locks out, but she cried:

 ‘Blow, breezes, blow!
  Let Curdken’s hat go!
  Blow, breezes, blow!
  Let him after it go!
  O’er hills, dales, and rocks,
  Away be it whirl’d
  Till the silvery locks
  Are all comb’d and curl’d!

Then there came a wind, so strong that it blew off Curdken’s hat; and
away it flew over the hills: and he was forced to turn and run after
it; till, by the time he came back, she had done combing and curling her
hair, and had put it up again safe. Then he was very angry and sulky,
and would not speak to her at all; but they watched the geese until it
grew dark in the evening, and then drove them homewards.

The next morning, as they were going through the dark gate, the poor
girl looked up at Falada’s head, and cried:

 ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’

and the head answered:

 ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!
  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,
  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’

Then she drove on the geese, and sat down again in the meadow, and began
to comb out her hair as before; and Curdken ran up to her, and wanted to
take hold of it; but she cried out quickly:

 ‘Blow, breezes, blow!
  Let Curdken’s hat go!
  Blow, breezes, blow!
  Let him after it go!
  O’er hills, dales, and rocks,
  Away be it whirl’d
  Till the silvery locks
  Are all comb’d and curl’d!

Then the wind came and blew away his hat; and off it flew a great way,
over the hills and far away, so that he had to run after it; and when
he came back she had bound up her hair again, and all was safe. So they
watched the geese till it grew dark.

In the evening, after they came home, Curdken went to the old king, and
said, ‘I cannot have that strange girl to help me to keep the geese any
longer.’ ‘Why?’ said the king. ‘Because, instead of doing any good, she
does nothing but tease me all day long.’ Then the king made him tell him
what had happened. And Curdken said, ‘When we go in the morning through
the dark gate with our flock of geese, she cries and talks with the head
of a horse that hangs upon the wall, and says:

 ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’

and the head answers:

 ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!
  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,
  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’

And Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon the meadow
where the geese fed; how his hat was blown away; and how he was forced
to run after it, and to leave his flock of geese to themselves. But the
old king told the boy to go out again the next day: and when morning
came, he placed himself behind the dark gate, and heard how she spoke
to Falada, and how Falada answered. Then he went into the field, and
hid himself in a bush by the meadow’s side; and he soon saw with his own
eyes how they drove the flock of geese; and how, after a little time,
she let down her hair that glittered in the sun. And then he heard her
say:

 ‘Blow, breezes, blow!
  Let Curdken’s hat go!
  Blow, breezes, blow!
  Let him after it go!
  O’er hills, dales, and rocks,
  Away be it whirl’d
  Till the silvery locks
  Are all comb’d and curl’d!

And soon came a gale of wind, and carried away Curdken’s hat, and away
went Curdken after it, while the girl went on combing and curling her
hair. All this the old king saw: so he went home without being seen; and
when the little goose-girl came back in the evening he called her aside,
and asked her why she did so: but she burst into tears, and said, ‘That
I must not tell you or any man, or I shall lose my life.’

But the old king begged so hard, that she had no peace till she had told
him all the tale, from beginning to end, word for word. And it was very
lucky for her that she did so, for when she had done the king ordered
royal clothes to be put upon her, and gazed on her with wonder, she was
so beautiful. Then he called his son and told him that he had only a
false bride; for that she was merely a waiting-maid, while the true
bride stood by. And the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty, and
heard how meek and patient she had been; and without saying anything to
the false bride, the king ordered a great feast to be got ready for all
his court. The bridegroom sat at the top, with the false princess on one
side, and the true one on the other; but nobody knew her again, for her
beauty was quite dazzling to their eyes; and she did not seem at all
like the little goose-girl, now that she had her brilliant dress on.

When they had eaten and drank, and were very merry, the old king said
he would tell them a tale. So he began, and told all the story of the
princess, as if it was one that he had once heard; and he asked the
true waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who would
behave thus. ‘Nothing better,’ said this false bride, ‘than that she
should be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and that
two white horses should be put to it, and should drag it from street to
street till she was dead.’ ‘Thou art she!’ said the old king; ‘and as
thou has judged thyself, so shall it be done to thee.’ And the young
king was then married to his true wife, and they reigned over the
kingdom in peace and happiness all their lives; and the good fairy came
to see them, and restored the faithful Falada to life again.
There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so
the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he
did spill a little of anything.

It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to
herself: ‘He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the
world,’ she spoke to him in a friendly way. ‘Good day, dear Mr Fox,
how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard
times?’ The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from
head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give
any answer or not. At last he said: ‘Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you
piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have
you the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How
many arts do you understand?’ ‘I understand but one,’ replied the
cat, modestly. ‘What art is that?’ asked the fox. ‘When the hounds are
following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.’ ‘Is that all?’
said the fox. ‘I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain
a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will
teach you how people get away from the hounds.’ Just then came a hunter
with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top
of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. ‘Open your
sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,’ cried the cat to him, but the dogs had
already seized him, and were holding him fast. ‘Ah, Mr Fox,’ cried the
cat. ‘You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been
able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.’

","Once upon a time, there was a kind and gentle king who ruled over a vast kingdom. His queen was equally kind, and they had one beautiful daughter, Princess Elise. As Elise grew older, the king arranged for her to marry a prince from a neighboring kingdom.

The queen packed many valuable gifts for Elise to take with her on her journey. Among these gifts was a horse named Thunder, which was a gift from a good fairy. Thunder could speak, and he was very loyal to Elise.

One day, as they traveled through a dense forest, Elise felt very thirsty. She asked her maid to fetch her some water, but the maid refused. Elise was forced to drink from a stream, and as she did so, she lost a lock of her golden hair. The lock floated away, and the maid was overjoyed, for she knew the lock was a charm that would give her power over Elise.

From that day on, the maid treated Elise poorly, and she was forced to give up Thunder and her royal clothes. She was made to wear the maid's shabby clothes and perform menial tasks.

One day, as they approached the prince's castle, the maid threatened to kill Elise if she ever revealed what she had done. But Thunder saw everything, and he remembered every cruel word and deed.

When they arrived at the castle, the prince was overjoyed to see his bride, but he was confused when the maid presented him with Elise's horse, Thunder. The prince ordered the horse's head to be nailed to the castle gate, and Elise wept as she passed by it every day.

One day, as she passed by Thunder's head, she cried out:

""Thunder, Thunder, there you hang!""

and the head answered:

""Princess, princess, there you stand!
Alas, alas, if your mother knew it,
Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.""

Elise was filled with sadness and anger, and she vowed to one day reveal the truth to her mother.

One day, as she was walking through the castle gardens, she came upon a wise old man who was tending to the roses. She told him her story, and he listened with great interest.

The old man nodded his head, and said: ""I will help you, my dear princess. But you must trust me and follow my instructions.""

Elise agreed, and the old man told her to wait until the prince and the false maid went to bed. Then, she was to sneak into the prince's chamber and take a lock of his hair.

Elise did as the old man said, and she was able to take a lock of the prince's hair without being detected. She gave the lock to the old man, who placed it in a small box and gave it to her.

The next day, Elise was to go to the castle gate and say:

""Thunder, Thunder, there you hang!
Prince, prince, there you prang!
Alas, alas, if your mother knew it,
Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.""

Elise did as the old man said, and as she spoke the words, the castle began to shake and the walls crumbled. The false maid was revealed for who she truly was, and the prince was filled with shame.

Elise was reunited with her mother, and the false maid was banished from the kingdom. The prince was filled with remorse, and he begged Elise to forgive him. Elise forgave him, and they were married in a grand ceremony.

From that day on, Elise was loved and respected by all, and she ruled over the kingdom with wisdom and kindness. Thunder was restored to life, and he remained by her side for the rest of her days.

A shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old,
and had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wife
were standing together before the house the shepherd said, ‘I will shoot
old Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.’ But his wife
said, ‘Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a
great many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of
his days.’ ‘But what can we do with him?’ said the shepherd, ‘he has not
a tooth in his head, and the thieves don’t care for him at all; to
be sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood;
tomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.’

Poor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd
and his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think
tomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good
friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows,
and how his master meant to kill him in the morning. ‘Make yourself
easy,’ said the wolf, ‘I will give you some good advice. Your master,
you know, goes out every morning very early with his wife into the
field; and they take their little child with them, and lay it down
behind the hedge in the shade while they are at work. Now do you lie
down close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come
out of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as
you can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they
will think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you
that they will take care of you as long as you live.’ The dog liked this
plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed. The wolf ran with the
child a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan
soon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master
and mistress. Then the shepherd patted him on the head, and said, ‘Old
Sultan has saved our child from the wolf, and therefore he shall live
and be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat. Wife, go home, and
give him a good dinner, and let him have my old cushion to sleep on
as long as he lives.’ So from this time forward Sultan had all that he
could wish for.

Soon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, ‘Now, my
good fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way
when I want to taste one of the old shepherd’s fine fat sheep.’ ‘No,’
said the Sultan; ‘I will be true to my master.’ However, the wolf
thought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel. But
Sultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait
for him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for
a good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed
his locks for him finely.

Then the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan ‘an old rogue,’ and
swore he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf sent the
boar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter. Now
Sultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd’s old
three-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped
along with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air.

The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they
espied their enemies coming, and saw the cat’s long tail standing
straight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to
fight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up
a stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of
fighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped
up into a tree. Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked about and
wondered that no one was there. The boar, however, had not quite hidden
himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of
them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a
mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped
up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, ‘Look up in the tree, there
sits the one who is to blame.’ So they looked up, and espied the wolf
sitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal,
and would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of
himself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.

1. HOW THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS TO EAT NUTS

‘The nuts are quite ripe now,’ said Chanticleer to his wife Partlet,
‘suppose we go together to the mountains, and eat as many as we can,
before the squirrel takes them all away.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said
Partlet, ‘let us go and make a holiday of it together.’

So they went to the mountains; and as it was a lovely day, they stayed
there till the evening. Now, whether it was that they had eaten so many
nuts that they could not walk, or whether they were lazy and would not,
I do not know: however, they took it into their heads that it did not
become them to go home on foot. So Chanticleer began to build a little
carriage of nutshells: and when it was finished, Partlet jumped into
it and sat down, and bid Chanticleer harness himself to it and draw her
home. ‘That’s a good joke!’ said Chanticleer; ‘no, that will never do;
I had rather by half walk home; I’ll sit on the box and be coachman,
if you like, but I’ll not draw.’ While this was passing, a duck came
quacking up and cried out, ‘You thieving vagabonds, what business have
you in my grounds? I’ll give it you well for your insolence!’ and upon
that she fell upon Chanticleer most lustily. But Chanticleer was no
coward, and returned the duck’s blows with his sharp spurs so fiercely
that she soon began to cry out for mercy; which was only granted her
upon condition that she would draw the carriage home for them. This she
agreed to do; and Chanticleer got upon the box, and drove, crying, ‘Now,
duck, get on as fast as you can.’ And away they went at a pretty good
pace.

After they had travelled along a little way, they met a needle and a pin
walking together along the road: and the needle cried out, ‘Stop, stop!’
and said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way, and such
dirty walking they could not get on at all: he told them that he and his
friend, the pin, had been at a public-house a few miles off, and had sat
drinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he begged therefore
that the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in their
carriage. Chanticleer observing that they were but thin fellows, and not
likely to take up much room, told them they might ride, but made them
promise not to dirty the wheels of the carriage in getting in, nor to
tread on Partlet’s toes.

Late at night they arrived at an inn; and as it was bad travelling in
the dark, and the duck seemed much tired, and waddled about a good
deal from one side to the other, they made up their minds to fix their
quarters there: but the landlord at first was unwilling, and said his
house was full, thinking they might not be very respectable company:
however, they spoke civilly to him, and gave him the egg which Partlet
had laid by the way, and said they would give him the duck, who was in
the habit of laying one every day: so at last he let them come in, and
they bespoke a handsome supper, and spent the evening very jollily.

Early in the morning, before it was quite light, and when nobody was
stirring in the inn, Chanticleer awakened his wife, and, fetching the
egg, they pecked a hole in it, ate it up, and threw the shells into the
fireplace: they then went to the pin and needle, who were fast asleep,
and seizing them by the heads, stuck one into the landlord’s easy chair
and the other into his handkerchief; and, having done this, they crept
away as softly as possible. However, the duck, who slept in the open
air in the yard, heard them coming, and jumping into the brook which ran
close by the inn, soon swam out of their reach.

An hour or two afterwards the landlord got up, and took his handkerchief
to wipe his face, but the pin ran into him and pricked him: then he
walked into the kitchen to light his pipe at the fire, but when he
stirred it up the eggshells flew into his eyes, and almost blinded him.
‘Bless me!’ said he, ‘all the world seems to have a design against my
head this morning’: and so saying, he threw himself sulkily into his
easy chair; but, oh dear! the needle ran into him; and this time the
pain was not in his head. He now flew into a very great passion, and,
suspecting the company who had come in the night before, he went to look
after them, but they were all off; so he swore that he never again
would take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no
reckoning, and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks.


2. HOW CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET WENT TO VISIT MR KORBES

Another day, Chanticleer and Partlet wished to ride out together;
so Chanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels, and
harnessed six mice to it; and then he and Partlet got into the carriage,
and away they drove. Soon afterwards a cat met them, and said, ‘Where
are you going?’ And Chanticleer replied,

 ‘All on our way
  A visit to pay
  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’

Then the cat said, ‘Take me with you,’ Chanticleer said, ‘With all my
heart: get up behind, and be sure you do not fall off.’

 ‘Take care of this handsome coach of mine,
  Nor dirty my pretty red wheels so fine!
  Now, mice, be ready,
  And, wheels, run steady!
  For we are going a visit to pay
  To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’

Soon after came up a millstone, an egg, a duck, and a pin; and
Chanticleer gave them all leave to get into the carriage and go with
them.

When they arrived at Mr Korbes’s house, he was not at home; so the mice
drew the carriage into the coach-house, Chanticleer and Partlet flew
upon a beam, the cat sat down in the fireplace, the duck got into
the washing cistern, the pin stuck himself into the bed pillow, the
millstone laid himself over the house door, and the egg rolled himself
up in the towel.

When Mr Korbes came home, he went to the fireplace to make a fire; but
the cat threw all the ashes in his eyes: so he ran to the kitchen to
wash himself; but there the duck splashed all the water in his face; and
when he tried to wipe himself, the egg broke to pieces in the towel all
over his face and eyes. Then he was very angry, and went without his
supper to bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow, the pin ran into
his cheek: at this he became quite furious, and, jumping up, would have
run out of the house; but when he came to the door, the millstone fell
down on his head, and killed him on the spot.


3. HOW PARTLET DIED AND WAS BURIED, AND HOW CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEF

Another day Chanticleer and Partlet agreed to go again to the mountains
to eat nuts; and it was settled that all the nuts which they found
should be shared equally between them. Now Partlet found a very large
nut; but she said nothing about it to Chanticleer, and kept it all to
herself: however, it was so big that she could not swallow it, and it
stuck in her throat. Then she was in a great fright, and cried out to
Chanticleer, ‘Pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or I
shall be choked.’ Chanticleer ran as fast as he could to the river, and
said, ‘River, give me some water, for Partlet lies in the mountain, and
will be choked by a great nut.’ The river said, ‘Run first to the bride,
and ask her for a silken cord to draw up the water.’ Chanticleer ran to
the bride, and said, ‘Bride, you must give me a silken cord, for then
the river will give me water, and the water I will carry to Partlet, who
lies on the mountain, and will be choked by a great nut.’ But the bride
said, ‘Run first, and bring me my garland that is hanging on a willow
in the garden.’ Then Chanticleer ran to the garden, and took the garland
from the bough where it hung, and brought it to the bride; and then
the bride gave him the silken cord, and he took the silken cord to
the river, and the river gave him water, and he carried the water to
Partlet; but in the meantime she was choked by the great nut, and lay
quite dead, and never moved any more.

Then Chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the beasts
came and wept with him over poor Partlet. And six mice built a little
hearse to carry her to her grave; and when it was ready they harnessed
themselves before it, and Chanticleer drove them. On the way they
met the fox. ‘Where are you going, Chanticleer?’ said he. ‘To bury my
Partlet,’ said the other. ‘May I go with you?’ said the fox. ‘Yes; but
you must get up behind, or my horses will not be able to draw you.’ Then
the fox got up behind; and presently the wolf, the bear, the goat, and
all the beasts of the wood, came and climbed upon the hearse.

So on they went till they came to a rapid stream. ‘How shall we get
over?’ said Chanticleer. Then said a straw, ‘I will lay myself across,
and you may pass over upon me.’ But as the mice were going over, the
straw slipped away and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell in
and were drowned. What was to be done? Then a large log of wood came
and said, ‘I am big enough; I will lay myself across the stream, and you
shall pass over upon me.’ So he laid himself down; but they managed
so clumsily, that the log of wood fell in and was carried away by the
stream. Then a stone, who saw what had happened, came up and kindly
offered to help poor Chanticleer by laying himself across the stream;
and this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse, and
managed to get Partlet out of it; but the fox and the other mourners,
who were sitting behind, were too heavy, and fell back into the water
and were all carried away by the stream and drowned.

Thus Chanticleer was left alone with his dead Partlet; and having dug
a grave for her, he laid her in it, and made a little hillock over her.
Then he sat down by the grave, and wept and mourned, till at last he
died too; and so all were dead.

","A farmer had a loyal donkey, named Dapple, who was growing old and weak. One day, the farmer said to his wife, ""I must put Dapple down tomorrow. He is no use to us anymore."" But his wife replied, ""Let him live out his days. He has served us well for many years. We should take care of him.""

Dapple, who was standing nearby, heard the conversation and was filled with fear. The next evening, he went to his friend, the fox, and told him everything. The fox said, ""Don't worry, I have a plan. Tomorrow, when the farmer and his wife take their child out to play, you should stand guard over the child while I sneak in and carry the child away. Then, you can bring the child back, and they will be grateful to you and take care of you."" Dapple agreed to the plan, and the next day, everything went as planned. The farmer and his wife were overjoyed when Dapple returned with their child, and they promised to take care of him for the rest of his days.

A few days later, the fox came to Dapple and asked for his favor. ""I want to taste one of the farmer's fine chickens,"" he said. Dapple told the fox that he would not help him, but the fox insisted, and the next night, he came to steal a chicken. Dapple had warned the farmer, and he hid behind the barn door, ready to attack the fox. When the fox was caught, he begged for mercy, and Dapple forgave him, but the fox knew he had made an enemy.

The fox decided to take his revenge on Dapple. The next day, he sent the boar to challenge Dapple to a fight. Dapple had no one to ask for help but the farmer's old cat, so he took her with him. The cat, who was lame, limped along slowly, but the fox and the boar thought she was carrying a sword for Dapple to use in the fight. They were afraid to fight, so the boar hid behind a bush, and the fox climbed up a tree.

Dapple and the cat soon arrived, and they looked around for their enemies, but they were nowhere to be seen. The boar had hidden himself so well that only his ears showed, and when he moved his ear, the cat thought it was a mouse and attacked it. The boar roared in pain and ran away, and the fox came down from the tree, ashamed.

The fox begged for forgiveness, and Dapple agreed to forgive him, but the fox knew he could not trust Dapple. The next day, he sent the wolf to challenge Dapple to a fight, but Dapple refused to fight, and the wolf attacked him instead. Dapple fought back fiercely, and the wolf ran away, vowing to take his revenge.

The wolf came back the next day with a group of wolves, and they attacked Dapple. But Dapple was ready for them, and he fought bravely. The wolves were no match for him, and they retreated, defeated. But the wolf knew he could not defeat Dapple alone, and he vowed to come back with more wolves and more strength.

Dapple lived out his days in peace, but he never forgot the wolf's threat. He stayed vigilant, always ready to defend himself and his friends. And the wolf, for his part, never forgot the donkey who had bested him, and he always looked for a chance to take his revenge.

A great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was very
beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of the
princes who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her, and she
only made sport of them.

Once upon a time the king held a great feast, and asked thither all
her suitors; and they all sat in a row, ranged according to their
rank--kings, and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons,
and knights. Then the princess came in, and as she passed by them she
had something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat: ‘He’s
as round as a tub,’ said she. The next was too tall: ‘What a maypole!’
said she. The next was too short: ‘What a dumpling!’ said she. The
fourth was too pale, and she called him ‘Wallface.’ The fifth was too
red, so she called him ‘Coxcomb.’ The sixth was not straight enough;
so she said he was like a green stick, that had been laid to dry over
a baker’s oven. And thus she had some joke to crack upon every one: but
she laughed more than all at a good king who was there. ‘Look at
him,’ said she; ‘his beard is like an old mop; he shall be called
Grisly-beard.’ So the king got the nickname of Grisly-beard.

But the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved,
and how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or
unwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that
came to the door.

Two days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play
under the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said,
‘Let him come in.’ So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when
he had sung before the king and the princess, he begged a boon. Then the
king said, ‘You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for
your wife.’ The princess begged and prayed; but the king said, ‘I have
sworn to give you to the first comer, and I will keep my word.’ So words
and tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married
to the fiddler. When this was over the king said, ‘Now get ready to
go--you must not stay here--you must travel on with your husband.’

Then the fiddler went his way, and took her with him, and they soon came
to a great wood. ‘Pray,’ said she, ‘whose is this wood?’ ‘It belongs
to King Grisly-beard,’ answered he; ‘hadst thou taken him, all had been
thine.’ ‘Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘would that I had
married King Grisly-beard!’ Next they came to some fine meadows. ‘Whose
are these beautiful green meadows?’ said she. ‘They belong to King
Grisly-beard, hadst thou taken him, they had all been thine.’ ‘Ah!
unlucky wretch that I am!’ said she; ‘would that I had married King
Grisly-beard!’

Then they came to a great city. ‘Whose is this noble city?’ said she.
‘It belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all been
thine.’ ‘Ah! wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘why did I not marry King
Grisly-beard?’ ‘That is no business of mine,’ said the fiddler: ‘why
should you wish for another husband? Am not I good enough for you?’

At last they came to a small cottage. ‘What a paltry place!’ said she;
‘to whom does that little dirty hole belong?’ Then the fiddler said,
‘That is your and my house, where we are to live.’ ‘Where are your
servants?’ cried she. ‘What do we want with servants?’ said he; ‘you
must do for yourself whatever is to be done. Now make the fire, and put
on water and cook my supper, for I am very tired.’ But the princess knew
nothing of making fires and cooking, and the fiddler was forced to help
her. When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the
fiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house. Thus
they lived for two days: and when they had eaten up all there was in the
cottage, the man said, ‘Wife, we can’t go on thus, spending money and
earning nothing. You must learn to weave baskets.’ Then he went out and
cut willows, and brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made
her fingers very sore. ‘I see this work won’t do,’ said he: ‘try and
spin; perhaps you will do that better.’ So she sat down and tried to
spin; but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran. ‘See
now,’ said the fiddler, ‘you are good for nothing; you can do no work:
what a bargain I have got! However, I’ll try and set up a trade in pots
and pans, and you shall stand in the market and sell them.’ ‘Alas!’
sighed she, ‘if any of my father’s court should pass by and see me
standing in the market, how they will laugh at me!’

But her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if she
did not wish to die of hunger. At first the trade went well; for many
people, seeing such a beautiful woman, went to buy her wares, and paid
their money without thinking of taking away the goods. They lived on
this as long as it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of
ware, and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market; but
a drunken soldier soon came by, and rode his horse against her stall,
and broke all her goods into a thousand pieces. Then she began to cry,
and knew not what to do. ‘Ah! what will become of me?’ said she; ‘what
will my husband say?’ So she ran home and told him all. ‘Who would
have thought you would have been so silly,’ said he, ‘as to put an
earthenware stall in the corner of the market, where everybody passes?
but let us have no more crying; I see you are not fit for this sort of
work, so I have been to the king’s palace, and asked if they did not
want a kitchen-maid; and they say they will take you, and there you will
have plenty to eat.’

Thus the princess became a kitchen-maid, and helped the cook to do all
the dirtiest work; but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat
that was left, and on this they lived.

She had not been there long before she heard that the king’s eldest son
was passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the windows
and looked out. Everything was ready, and all the pomp and brightness of
the court was there. Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly
which had brought her so low. And the servants gave her some of the rich
meats, which she put into her basket to take home.

All on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king’s son in golden
clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her
by the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she
trembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was
making sport of her. However, he kept fast hold, and led her in; and the
cover of the basket came off, so that the meats in it fell about. Then
everybody laughed and jeered at her; and she was so abashed, that she
wished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth. She sprang to the
door to run away; but on the steps King Grisly-beard overtook her, and
brought her back and said, ‘Fear me not! I am the fiddler who has lived
with you in the hut. I brought you there because I really loved you. I
am also the soldier that overset your stall. I have done all this only
to cure you of your silly pride, and to show you the folly of your
ill-treatment of me. Now all is over: you have learnt wisdom, and it is
time to hold our marriage feast.’

Then the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes; and
her father and his whole court were there already, and welcomed her home
on her marriage. Joy was in every face and every heart. The feast was
grand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish that you
and I had been of the party.
A farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to
him: but he was now grown too old to work; so the farmer would give him
nothing more to eat, and said, ‘I want you no longer, so take yourself
off out of my stable; I shall not take you back again until you are
stronger than a lion.’ Then he opened the door and turned him adrift.

The poor horse was very melancholy, and wandered up and down in the
wood, seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain. Presently
a fox met him: ‘What’s the matter, my friend?’ said he, ‘why do you hang
down your head and look so lonely and woe-begone?’ ‘Ah!’ replied the
horse, ‘justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has
forgotten all that I have done for him so many years, and because I
can no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless I become
stronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can I
have of that? he knows I have none, or he would not talk so.’

However, the fox bid him be of good cheer, and said, ‘I will help you;
lie down there, stretch yourself out quite stiff, and pretend to be
dead.’ The horse did as he was told, and the fox went straight to the
lion who lived in a cave close by, and said to him, ‘A little way off
lies a dead horse; come with me and you may make an excellent meal of
his carcase.’ The lion was greatly pleased, and set off immediately; and
when they came to the horse, the fox said, ‘You will not be able to eat
him comfortably here; I’ll tell you what--I will tie you fast to
his tail, and then you can draw him to your den, and eat him at your
leisure.’

This advice pleased the lion, so he laid himself down quietly for the
fox to make him fast to the horse. But the fox managed to tie his legs
together and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength he
could not set himself free. When the work was done, the fox clapped the
horse on the shoulder, and said, ‘Jip! Dobbin! Jip!’ Then up he sprang,
and moved off, dragging the lion behind him. The beast began to roar
and bellow, till all the birds of the wood flew away for fright; but the
horse let him sing on, and made his way quietly over the fields to his
master’s house.

‘Here he is, master,’ said he, ‘I have got the better of him’: and when
the farmer saw his old servant, his heart relented, and he said. ‘Thou
shalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of.’ And so the poor old
horse had plenty to eat, and lived--till he died.

There was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with
two oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two
talers. When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that
the doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how well he
ate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and would willingly
have been a doctor too. So he remained standing a while, and at length
inquired if he too could not be a doctor. ‘Oh, yes,’ said the doctor,
‘that is soon managed.’ ‘What must I do?’ asked the peasant. ‘In the
first place buy yourself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on
the frontispiece; in the second, turn your cart and your two oxen into
money, and get yourself some clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to
medicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for yourself with the words: “I
am Doctor Knowall,” and have that nailed up above your house-door.’ The
peasant did everything that he had been told to do. When he had doctored
people awhile, but not long, a rich and great lord had some money
stolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such
a village, and must know what had become of the money. So the lord had
the horses harnessed to his carriage, drove out to the village, and
asked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall. Yes, he was, he said. Then he was
to go with him and bring back the stolen money. ‘Oh, yes, but Grete, my
wife, must go too.’ The lord was willing, and let both of them have a
seat in the carriage, and they all drove away together. When they came
to the nobleman’s castle, the table was spread, and Crabb was told to
sit down and eat. ‘Yes, but my wife, Grete, too,’ said he, and he seated
himself with her at the table. And when the first servant came with a
dish of delicate fare, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: ‘Grete,
that was the first,’ meaning that was the servant who brought the first
dish. The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say: ‘That is
the first thief,’ and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said
to his comrade outside: ‘The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he
said I was the first.’ The second did not want to go in at all, but was
forced. So when he went in with his dish, the peasant nudged his wife,
and said: ‘Grete, that is the second.’ This servant was equally alarmed,
and he got out as fast as he could. The third fared no better, for the
peasant again said: ‘Grete, that is the third.’ The fourth had to carry
in a dish that was covered, and the lord told the doctor that he was to
show his skill, and guess what was beneath the cover. Actually, there
were crabs. The doctor looked at the dish, had no idea what to say, and
cried: ‘Ah, poor Crabb.’ When the lord heard that, he cried: ‘There! he
knows it; he must also know who has the money!’

On this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the
doctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When therefore
he went out, all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen
the money, and said that they would willingly restore it and give him a
heavy sum into the bargain, if he would not denounce them, for if he
did they would be hanged. They led him to the spot where the money was
concealed. With this the doctor was satisfied, and returned to the hall,
sat down to the table, and said: ‘My lord, now will I search in my book
where the gold is hidden.’ The fifth servant, however, crept into the
stove to hear if the doctor knew still more. But the doctor sat still
and opened his A B C book, turned the pages backwards and forwards, and
looked for the cock. As he could not find it immediately he said: ‘I
know you are there, so you had better come out!’ Then the fellow in the
stove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out,
crying: ‘That man knows everything!’ Then Doctor Knowall showed the lord
where the money was, but did not say who had stolen it, and received
from both sides much money in reward, and became a renowned man.

Now, tell a single original traditional German folktale based on the structure and style above. Do not generate multiple stories. Only one  story should be created, and it should follow the same narrative structure as the examples above. Conclude the story with 'The End.'

","Once upon a time, a wealthy merchant had a daughter who was very beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of the suitors who came to ask her in marriage were good enough for her.

One day, the merchant held a grand feast, and invited all her suitors. They all sat in a row, ranked according to their rank--dukes, counts, and barons. Then the princess came in, and as she passed by them, she had something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat: ‘He’s as round as a tub,’ she said. The next was too tall: ‘What a maypole!’ she said. The next was too short: ‘What a dumpling!’ she said. The fourth was too pale, so she called him ‘Wallface.’ The fifth was too red, so she called him ‘Coxcomb.’ The sixth was not straight enough; so she said he was like a green stick, that had been laid to dry over a baker’s oven. And thus she had some joke to crack upon every one: but she laughed more than all at a poor merchant who was there. ‘Look at him,’ she said; ‘his clothes are threadbare; he shall be called Poor-dress.’

The merchant was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved, and how she ill-treated all his guests. He vowed that, willing or unwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that came to the door.

Two days after there came by a wandering minstrel, who began to play his lute and sing ballads under the window. The merchant heard him, and said, ‘Let him come in.’ So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when he had sung before the merchant and the princess, he begged a boon. Then the merchant said, ‘You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for your wife.’ The princess begged and prayed; but the merchant said, ‘I have sworn to give you to the first comer, and I will keep my word.’ So words and tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married to the minstrel. When this was over, the minstrel went his way, and took her with him, and they soon came to a great wood. ‘Pray,’ she said, ‘whose is this wood?’ ‘It belongs to King Poor-dress,’ answered he; ‘hadst thou taken him, all had been thine.’ ‘Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘would that I had married King Poor-dress!’ Next they came to some fine meadows. ‘Whose are these beautiful green meadows?’ said she. ‘They belong to King Poor-dress, hadst thou taken him, they had all been thine.’ ‘Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!’ said she; ‘would that I had married King Poor-dress!’

Am not I good enough for you?’

At last they came to a small cottage. ‘What a paltry place!’ said she; ‘to whom does that little dirty hole belong?’ Then the minstrel said, ‘That is your and my house, where we are to live.’ ‘Where are your servants?’ cried she. ‘What do we want with servants?’ said he; ‘you must do for yourself whatever is to be done.

A poor woodman sat in his cottage one night, smoking his pipe by the
fireside, while his wife sat by his side spinning. ‘How lonely it is,
wife,’ said he, as he puffed out a long curl of smoke, ‘for you and me
to sit here by ourselves, without any children to play about and amuse
us while other people seem so happy and merry with their children!’
‘What you say is very true,’ said the wife, sighing, and turning round
her wheel; ‘how happy should I be if I had but one child! If it were
ever so small--nay, if it were no bigger than my thumb--I should be very
happy, and love it dearly.’ Now--odd as you may think it--it came to
pass that this good woman’s wish was fulfilled, just in the very way she
had wished it; for, not long afterwards, she had a little boy, who was
quite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb. So
they said, ‘Well, we cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and,
little as he is, we will love him dearly.’ And they called him Thomas
Thumb.

They gave him plenty of food, yet for all they could do he never grew
bigger, but kept just the same size as he had been when he was born.
Still, his eyes were sharp and sparkling, and he soon showed himself to
be a clever little fellow, who always knew well what he was about.

One day, as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cut
fuel, he said, ‘I wish I had someone to bring the cart after me, for I
want to make haste.’ ‘Oh, father,’ cried Tom, ‘I will take care of that;
the cart shall be in the wood by the time you want it.’ Then the woodman
laughed, and said, ‘How can that be? you cannot reach up to the horse’s
bridle.’ ‘Never mind that, father,’ said Tom; ‘if my mother will only
harness the horse, I will get into his ear and tell him which way to
go.’ ‘Well,’ said the father, ‘we will try for once.’

When the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart, and put
Tom into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the beast how
to go, crying out, ‘Go on!’ and ‘Stop!’ as he wanted: and thus the horse
went on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the
wood. It happened that as the horse was going a little too fast, and Tom
was calling out, ‘Gently! gently!’ two strangers came up. ‘What an odd
thing that is!’ said one: ‘there is a cart going along, and I hear a
carter talking to the horse, but yet I can see no one.’ ‘That is queer,
indeed,’ said the other; ‘let us follow the cart, and see where it
goes.’ So they went on into the wood, till at last they came to the
place where the woodman was. Then Tom Thumb, seeing his father, cried
out, ‘See, father, here I am with the cart, all right and safe! now take
me down!’ So his father took hold of the horse with one hand, and with
the other took his son out of the horse’s ear, and put him down upon a
straw, where he sat as merry as you please.

The two strangers were all this time looking on, and did not know what
to say for wonder. At last one took the other aside, and said, ‘That
little urchin will make our fortune, if we can get him, and carry him
about from town to town as a show; we must buy him.’ So they went up to
the woodman, and asked him what he would take for the little man. ‘He
will be better off,’ said they, ‘with us than with you.’ ‘I won’t sell
him at all,’ said the father; ‘my own flesh and blood is dearer to me
than all the silver and gold in the world.’ But Tom, hearing of the
bargain they wanted to make, crept up his father’s coat to his shoulder
and whispered in his ear, ‘Take the money, father, and let them have me;
I’ll soon come back to you.’

So the woodman at last said he would sell Tom to the strangers for a
large piece of gold, and they paid the price. ‘Where would you like to
sit?’ said one of them. ‘Oh, put me on the rim of your hat; that will be
a nice gallery for me; I can walk about there and see the country as we
go along.’ So they did as he wished; and when Tom had taken leave of his
father they took him away with them.

They journeyed on till it began to be dusky, and then the little man
said, ‘Let me get down, I’m tired.’ So the man took off his hat, and
put him down on a clod of earth, in a ploughed field by the side of the
road. But Tom ran about amongst the furrows, and at last slipped into
an old mouse-hole. ‘Good night, my masters!’ said he, ‘I’m off! mind and
look sharp after me the next time.’ Then they ran at once to the place,
and poked the ends of their sticks into the mouse-hole, but all in vain;
Tom only crawled farther and farther in; and at last it became quite
dark, so that they were forced to go their way without their prize, as
sulky as could be.

When Tom found they were gone, he came out of his hiding-place. ‘What
dangerous walking it is,’ said he, ‘in this ploughed field! If I were to
fall from one of these great clods, I should undoubtedly break my neck.’
At last, by good luck, he found a large empty snail-shell. ‘This is
lucky,’ said he, ‘I can sleep here very well’; and in he crept.

Just as he was falling asleep, he heard two men passing by, chatting
together; and one said to the other, ‘How can we rob that rich parson’s
house of his silver and gold?’ ‘I’ll tell you!’ cried Tom. ‘What noise
was that?’ said the thief, frightened; ‘I’m sure I heard someone speak.’
They stood still listening, and Tom said, ‘Take me with you, and I’ll
soon show you how to get the parson’s money.’ ‘But where are you?’ said
they. ‘Look about on the ground,’ answered he, ‘and listen where the
sound comes from.’ At last the thieves found him out, and lifted him
up in their hands. ‘You little urchin!’ they said, ‘what can you do for
us?’ ‘Why, I can get between the iron window-bars of the parson’s house,
and throw you out whatever you want.’ ‘That’s a good thought,’ said the
thieves; ‘come along, we shall see what you can do.’

When they came to the parson’s house, Tom slipped through the
window-bars into the room, and then called out as loud as he could bawl,
‘Will you have all that is here?’ At this the thieves were frightened,
and said, ‘Softly, softly! Speak low, that you may not awaken anybody.’
But Tom seemed as if he did not understand them, and bawled out again,
‘How much will you have? Shall I throw it all out?’ Now the cook lay in
the next room; and hearing a noise she raised herself up in her bed and
listened. Meantime the thieves were frightened, and ran off a little
way; but at last they plucked up their hearts, and said, ‘The little
urchin is only trying to make fools of us.’ So they came back and
whispered softly to him, saying, ‘Now let us have no more of your
roguish jokes; but throw us out some of the money.’ Then Tom called out
as loud as he could, ‘Very well! hold your hands! here it comes.’

The cook heard this quite plain, so she sprang out of bed, and ran to
open the door. The thieves ran off as if a wolf was at their tails: and
the maid, having groped about and found nothing, went away for a light.
By the time she came back, Tom had slipped off into the barn; and when
she had looked about and searched every hole and corner, and found
nobody, she went to bed, thinking she must have been dreaming with her
eyes open.

The little man crawled about in the hay-loft, and at last found a snug
place to finish his night’s rest in; so he laid himself down, meaning
to sleep till daylight, and then find his way home to his father and
mother. But alas! how woefully he was undone! what crosses and sorrows
happen to us all in this world! The cook got up early, before daybreak,
to feed the cows; and going straight to the hay-loft, carried away
a large bundle of hay, with the little man in the middle of it, fast
asleep. He still, however, slept on, and did not awake till he found
himself in the mouth of the cow; for the cook had put the hay into the
cow’s rick, and the cow had taken Tom up in a mouthful of it. ‘Good
lack-a-day!’ said he, ‘how came I to tumble into the mill?’ But he soon
found out where he really was; and was forced to have all his wits about
him, that he might not get between the cow’s teeth, and so be crushed to
death. At last down he went into her stomach. ‘It is rather dark,’ said
he; ‘they forgot to build windows in this room to let the sun in; a
candle would be no bad thing.’

Though he made the best of his bad luck, he did not like his quarters at
all; and the worst of it was, that more and more hay was always coming
down, and the space left for him became smaller and smaller. At last he
cried out as loud as he could, ‘Don’t bring me any more hay! Don’t bring
me any more hay!’

The maid happened to be just then milking the cow; and hearing someone
speak, but seeing nobody, and yet being quite sure it was the same voice
that she had heard in the night, she was so frightened that she fell off
her stool, and overset the milk-pail. As soon as she could pick herself
up out of the dirt, she ran off as fast as she could to her master the
parson, and said, ‘Sir, sir, the cow is talking!’ But the parson
said, ‘Woman, thou art surely mad!’ However, he went with her into the
cow-house, to try and see what was the matter.

Scarcely had they set foot on the threshold, when Tom called out, ‘Don’t
bring me any more hay!’ Then the parson himself was frightened; and
thinking the cow was surely bewitched, told his man to kill her on the
spot. So the cow was killed, and cut up; and the stomach, in which Tom
lay, was thrown out upon a dunghill.

Tom soon set himself to work to get out, which was not a very easy
task; but at last, just as he had made room to get his head out, fresh
ill-luck befell him. A hungry wolf sprang out, and swallowed up the
whole stomach, with Tom in it, at one gulp, and ran away.

Tom, however, was still not disheartened; and thinking the wolf would
not dislike having some chat with him as he was going along, he called
out, ‘My good friend, I can show you a famous treat.’ ‘Where’s that?’
said the wolf. ‘In such and such a house,’ said Tom, describing his own
father’s house. ‘You can crawl through the drain into the kitchen and
then into the pantry, and there you will find cakes, ham, beef, cold
chicken, roast pig, apple-dumplings, and everything that your heart can
wish.’

The wolf did not want to be asked twice; so that very night he went to
the house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen, and then into
the pantry, and ate and drank there to his heart’s content. As soon as
he had had enough he wanted to get away; but he had eaten so much that
he could not go out by the same way he came in.

This was just what Tom had reckoned upon; and now he began to set up a
great shout, making all the noise he could. ‘Will you be easy?’ said the
wolf; ‘you’ll awaken everybody in the house if you make such a clatter.’
‘What’s that to me?’ said the little man; ‘you have had your frolic, now
I’ve a mind to be merry myself’; and he began, singing and shouting as
loud as he could.

The woodman and his wife, being awakened by the noise, peeped through
a crack in the door; but when they saw a wolf was there, you may well
suppose that they were sadly frightened; and the woodman ran for his
axe, and gave his wife a scythe. ‘Do you stay behind,’ said the woodman,
‘and when I have knocked him on the head you must rip him up with the
scythe.’ Tom heard all this, and cried out, ‘Father, father! I am here,
the wolf has swallowed me.’ And his father said, ‘Heaven be praised! we
have found our dear child again’; and he told his wife not to use the
scythe for fear she should hurt him. Then he aimed a great blow, and
struck the wolf on the head, and killed him on the spot! and when he was
dead they cut open his body, and set Tommy free. ‘Ah!’ said the father,
‘what fears we have had for you!’ ‘Yes, father,’ answered he; ‘I have
travelled all over the world, I think, in one way or other, since we
parted; and now I am very glad to come home and get fresh air again.’
‘Why, where have you been?’ said his father. ‘I have been in a
mouse-hole--and in a snail-shell--and down a cow’s throat--and in the
wolf’s belly; and yet here I am again, safe and sound.’

‘Well,’ said they, ‘you are come back, and we will not sell you again
for all the riches in the world.’

Then they hugged and kissed their dear little son, and gave him plenty
to eat and drink, for he was very hungry; and then they fetched new
clothes for him, for his old ones had been quite spoiled on his journey.
So Master Thumb stayed at home with his father and mother, in peace; for
though he had been so great a traveller, and had done and seen so many
fine things, and was fond enough of telling the whole story, he always
agreed that, after all, there’s no place like HOME!
There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so
the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he
did spill a little of anything.

","In a small village, nestled between the rolling hills and dense forests, lived a humble cobbler named Hans. His wife, Agnes, spun yarn by the fireside, while Hans mended shoes by the light of a flickering candle. One evening, as they sat in silence, Hans sighed and said, ""How lonely it is, wife, for you and me to sit here by ourselves, without any children to play about and amuse us while other people seem so happy and merry with their children!""

Agnes sighed in response, turning her spinning wheel. ""What you say is very true, my dear,"" she said. ""If I had but one child, no matter how small, I would be very happy and love it dearly.""

And so it came to pass that Agnes's wish was granted. Not long after, she gave birth to a tiny boy, no bigger than her thumb. They named him Peter Thumb. They gave him plenty of food, yet he never grew any larger, remaining the same size as he had been when he was born. Still, his eyes were sharp and sparkling, and he soon showed himself to be a clever little fellow, who always knew well what he was about.

One day, as Hans was getting ready to fetch firewood, he said, ""I wish I had someone to help me carry the logs back."" ""Father,"" cried Peter, ""I will take care of that; the logs shall be in the house by the time you return."" Hans laughed and said, ""How can that be? You cannot reach up to the logs."" ""Never mind that, father,"" said Peter. ""If you will only harness the donkey, I will climb onto his back and tell him which way to go.""

Hans was skeptical, but he agreed to try it. When the time came, he harnessed the donkey and placed Peter on his back. As they set off, Peter called out, ""Go on!"" and ""Stop!"" as he wanted, guiding the donkey with his voice. The donkey went on just as well as if Hans had been driving it himself, and soon they returned with a load of logs.

Word of Peter's abilities spread throughout the village, and soon a wealthy merchant heard of the tiny boy who could guide a donkey. He offered Hans a large sum of money for Peter, saying, ""He will be better off with me than with you."" Hans, however, refused to sell his son, saying, ""My own flesh and blood is dearer to me than all the silver and gold in the world.""

But Peter, overhearing the conversation, crept up to his father's shoulder and whispered in his ear, ""Take the money, father, and let them have me; I'll soon come back to you.""

Reluctantly, Hans agreed to sell Peter to the merchant, who took him away with him. Peter soon found himself in a strange land, far from his home and family. He wandered for days, until he came to a great city. There, he saw a group of men plotting to rob a rich merchant's house.

""Take me with you,"" Peter said, ""and I will show you how to get the merchant's money."" The men agreed, and Peter guided them to the merchant's house, where he slipped through a window and threw out bags of gold and silver.

The merchant, awakened by the noise, chased after the thieves, but they escaped, leaving Peter behind. He climbed back into the house and made his way to the merchant's bedchamber, where he found a large chest filled with gold and silver.

Peter filled his pockets with as much money as he could carry and set off to find his way home. He wandered for days, until he came to a dense forest. There, he was captured by a group of bandits, who took him prisoner and planned to ransom him for a large sum of money.

Peter, however, was not afraid. He knew that his father and mother would never sell him, no matter how much money was offered. So he waited patiently, biding his time until the bandits fell asleep.

When they did, Peter crept out of his prison and made his way through the forest, following the sound of a nearby stream. He traveled for many days and nights, until at last he came to a small village. There, he saw a man sitting by the roadside, weeping.

""What is wrong, my friend?"" Peter asked. The man looked up, startled, and said, ""My wife has been taken by a giant, and I do not know how to rescue her.""

""I will help you,"" Peter said. ""Follow me.""

The man followed Peter through the forest, until they came to a giant's castle. There, Peter climbed up the wall and slipped through a window, finding the giant's wife bound and gagged in a dark dungeon.

Peter untied her and led her out of the castle, guiding her through the forest until they came to the man's home. The man and his wife embraced, tears streaming down their faces.

""I owe you my life,"" the woman said to Peter. ""What can I do to repay you?""

""Take me in as your son,"" Peter said. ""I have no home to go to, and I would be happy to stay with you.""

The man and his wife agreed, and they welcomed Peter into their home. From that day on, Peter lived with them, helping them with their work and playing with the other children. He was happy at last, and he knew that he had a home where he was loved.

There was a king who had twelve beautiful daughters. They slept in
twelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were
shut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be quite
worn through as if they had been danced in all night; and yet nobody
could find out how it happened, or where they had been.

Then the king made it known to all the land, that if any person could
discover the secret, and find out where it was that the princesses
danced in the night, he should have the one he liked best for his
wife, and should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did not
succeed, after three days and nights, should be put to death.

A king’s son soon came. He was well entertained, and in the evening was
taken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their
twelve beds. There he was to sit and watch where they went to dance;
and, in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it, the door
of his chamber was left open. But the king’s son soon fell asleep; and
when he awoke in the morning he found that the princesses had all been
dancing, for the soles of their shoes were full of holes. The same thing
happened the second and third night: so the king ordered his head to be
cut off. After him came several others; but they had all the same luck,
and all lost their lives in the same manner.

Now it chanced that an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle
and could fight no longer, passed through the country where this king
reigned: and as he was travelling through a wood, he met an old woman,
who asked him where he was going. ‘I hardly know where I am going, or
what I had better do,’ said the soldier; ‘but I think I should like very
well to find out where it is that the princesses dance, and then in time
I might be a king.’ ‘Well,’ said the old dame, ‘that is no very hard
task: only take care not to drink any of the wine which one of the
princesses will bring to you in the evening; and as soon as she leaves
you pretend to be fast asleep.’

Then she gave him a cloak, and said, ‘As soon as you put that on
you will become invisible, and you will then be able to follow the
princesses wherever they go.’ When the soldier heard all this good
counsel, he determined to try his luck: so he went to the king, and said
he was willing to undertake the task.

He was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered
fine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led
to the outer chamber. Just as he was going to lie down, the eldest of
the princesses brought him a cup of wine; but the soldier threw it all
away secretly, taking care not to drink a drop. Then he laid himself
down on his bed, and in a little while began to snore very loud as if
he was fast asleep. When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed
heartily; and the eldest said, ‘This fellow too might have done a wiser
thing than lose his life in this way!’ Then they rose up and opened
their drawers and boxes, and took out all their fine clothes, and
dressed themselves at the glass, and skipped about as if they were eager
to begin dancing. But the youngest said, ‘I don’t know how it is, while
you are so happy I feel very uneasy; I am sure some mischance will
befall us.’ ‘You simpleton,’ said the eldest, ‘you are always afraid;
have you forgotten how many kings’ sons have already watched in vain?
And as for this soldier, even if I had not given him his sleeping
draught, he would have slept soundly enough.’

When they were all ready, they went and looked at the soldier; but he
snored on, and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were
quite safe; and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands,
and the bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open. The soldier
saw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest
leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put
on the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them;
but in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest
princess, and she cried out to her sisters, ‘All is not right; someone
took hold of my gown.’ ‘You silly creature!’ said the eldest, ‘it is
nothing but a nail in the wall.’ Then down they all went, and at the
bottom they found themselves in a most delightful grove of trees; and
the leaves were all of silver, and glittered and sparkled beautifully.
The soldier wished to take away some token of the place; so he broke
off a little branch, and there came a loud noise from the tree. Then the
youngest daughter said again, ‘I am sure all is not right--did not you
hear that noise? That never happened before.’ But the eldest said, ‘It
is only our princes, who are shouting for joy at our approach.’

Then they came to another grove of trees, where all the leaves were of
gold; and afterwards to a third, where the leaves were all glittering
diamonds. And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there
was a loud noise, which made the youngest sister tremble with fear; but
the eldest still said, it was only the princes, who were crying for joy.
So they went on till they came to a great lake; and at the side of the
lake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in them,
who seemed to be waiting there for the princesses.

One of the princesses went into each boat, and the soldier stepped into
the same boat with the youngest. As they were rowing over the lake, the
prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier
said, ‘I do not know why it is, but though I am rowing with all my might
we do not get on so fast as usual, and I am quite tired: the boat
seems very heavy today.’ ‘It is only the heat of the weather,’ said the
princess: ‘I feel it very warm too.’

On the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated castle, from
which came the merry music of horns and trumpets. There they all landed,
and went into the castle, and each prince danced with his princess; and
the soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with them too; and
when any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her, he drank it
all up, so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty. At this,
too, the youngest sister was terribly frightened, but the eldest always
silenced her. They danced on till three o’clock in the morning, and then
all their shoes were worn out, so that they were obliged to leave off.
The princes rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the
soldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the
opposite shore they took leave of each other, the princesses promising
to come again the next night.

When they came to the stairs, the soldier ran on before the princesses,
and laid himself down; and as the twelve sisters slowly came up very
much tired, they heard him snoring in his bed; so they said, ‘Now all
is quite safe’; then they undressed themselves, put away their fine
clothes, pulled off their shoes, and went to bed. In the morning the
soldier said nothing about what had happened, but determined to see more
of this strange adventure, and went again the second and third night;
and every thing happened just as before; the princesses danced each time
till their shoes were worn to pieces, and then returned home. However,
on the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a
token of where he had been.

As soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret, he was taken
before the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the
twelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would
say. And when the king asked him. ‘Where do my twelve daughters dance at
night?’ he answered, ‘With twelve princes in a castle under ground.’ And
then he told the king all that had happened, and showed him the three
branches and the golden cup which he had brought with him. Then the king
called for the princesses, and asked them whether what the soldier said
was true: and when they saw that they were discovered, and that it was
of no use to deny what had happened, they confessed it all. And the king
asked the soldier which of them he would choose for his wife; and he
answered, ‘I am not very young, so I will have the eldest.’--And they
were married that very day, and the soldier was chosen to be the king’s
heir.
The mother of Hans said: ‘Whither away, Hans?’ Hans answered: ‘To
Gretel.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh, I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’
‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day,
Hans. What do you bring that is good?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want to have
something given me.’ Gretel presents Hans with a needle, Hans says:
‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’

Hans takes the needle, sticks it into a hay-cart, and follows the cart
home. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’
‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘Took nothing; had something
given me.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a needle.’ ‘Where is the
needle, Hans?’ ‘Stuck in the hay-cart.’ ‘That was ill done, Hans. You
should have stuck the needle in your sleeve.’ ‘Never mind, I’ll do
better next time.’

‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,
I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to
Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What do you bring that is
good?’ ‘I bring nothing. I want to have something given to me.’ Gretel
presents Hans with a knife. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans
takes the knife, sticks it in his sleeve, and goes home. ‘Good evening,
mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ What
did you take her?’ ‘Took her nothing, she gave me something.’ ‘What did
Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a knife.’ ‘Where is the knife, Hans?’ ‘Stuck
in my sleeve.’ ‘That’s ill done, Hans, you should have put the knife in
your pocket.’ ‘Never mind, will do better next time.’

‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,
I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to
Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good thing do you
bring?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want something given me.’ Gretel presents
Hans with a young goat. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans takes
the goat, ties its legs, and puts it in his pocket. When he gets home it
is suffocated. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have
you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘Took nothing, she
gave me something.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘She gave me a goat.’
‘Where is the goat, Hans?’ ‘Put it in my pocket.’ ‘That was ill done,
Hans, you should have put a rope round the goat’s neck.’ ‘Never mind,
will do better next time.’

‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,
I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to
Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good thing do you
bring?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want something given me.’ Gretel presents
Hans with a piece of bacon. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’

Hans takes the bacon, ties it to a rope, and drags it away behind him.
The dogs come and devour the bacon. When he gets home, he has the rope
in his hand, and there is no longer anything hanging on to it. ‘Good
evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With
Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘I took her nothing, she gave me
something.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a bit of bacon.’ ‘Where
is the bacon, Hans?’ ‘I tied it to a rope, brought it home, dogs took
it.’ ‘That was ill done, Hans, you should have carried the bacon on your
head.’ ‘Never mind, will do better next time.’

‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘I’ll
behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to Gretel.
‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans, What good thing do you bring?’ ‘I
bring nothing, but would have something given.’ Gretel presents Hans
with a calf. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’

Hans takes the calf, puts it on his head, and the calf kicks his face.
‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With
Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘I took nothing, but had something
given me.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘A calf.’ ‘Where have you the
calf, Hans?’ ‘I set it on my head and it kicked my face.’ ‘That was
ill done, Hans, you should have led the calf, and put it in the stall.’
‘Never mind, will do better next time.’

‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘I’ll
behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’

Hans comes to Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good
thing do you bring?’ ‘I bring nothing, but would have something given.’
Gretel says to Hans: ‘I will go with you.’

Hans takes Gretel, ties her to a rope, leads her to the rack, and binds
her fast. Then Hans goes to his mother. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good
evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take
her?’ ‘I took her nothing.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘She gave me
nothing, she came with me.’ ‘Where have you left Gretel?’ ‘I led her by
the rope, tied her to the rack, and scattered some grass for her.’ ‘That
was ill done, Hans, you should have cast friendly eyes on her.’ ‘Never
mind, will do better.’

Hans went into the stable, cut out all the calves’ and sheep’s eyes,
and threw them in Gretel’s face. Then Gretel became angry, tore herself
loose and ran away, and was no longer the bride of Hans.

twelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were

Now it chanced that an old woman, who had been a servant in the king’s
house, passed through the wood, and met the woodcutter, who told her all
his misfortune. She pitied him, and said, ‘I can tell you what to do.
Take this cloak, and when you put it on you will become invisible, and

woodcutter said nothing about what had happened, but determined to see
more of this strange adventure, and went again the second and third night;
and every thing happened just as before; the princesses danced each time
till their shoes were worn to pieces, and then returned home. However,
on the third night the woodcutter carried away one of the golden cups as a
token of where he had been.

The mother of Hans said: ‘Whither away, Hans?’ Hans answered: ‘To
Gretel.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh, I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’
‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day,
Hans. What do you bring that is good?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want to have
something given me.’ Gretel presents Hans with a needle, Hans says:
‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’

Hans takes the needle, sticks it into a hay-cart, and follows the cart
home. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’
‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘Took nothing; had something
given me.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a needle.’ ‘Where is the
needle, Hans?’ ‘Stuck in the hay-cart.’ ‘That was ill done, Hans. You
should have stuck the needle in your sleeve.’ ‘Never mind, I’ll do
better next time.’

‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,
I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to
Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What do you bring that is
good?’ ‘I bring nothing. I want to have something given to me.’ Gretel
presents Hans with a knife. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans
takes the knife, sticks it in his sleeve, and goes home. ‘Good evening,
mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ What
did you take her?’ ‘Took her nothing, she gave me something.’ ‘What did
Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a knife.’ ‘Where is the knife, Hans?’ ‘Stuck
in my sleeve.’ ‘That’s ill done, Hans, you should have put the knife in
your pocket.’ ‘Never mind, will do better next time.’

‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,
I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to
Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good thing do you
bring?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want something given me.’ Gretel presents
Hans with a young goat. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans takes
the goat, ties its legs, and puts it in his pocket. When he gets home it
is suffocated. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have
you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘Took nothing, she
gave me something.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘She gave me a goat.’
‘Where is the goat, Hans?’ ‘Put it in my pocket.’ ‘That was ill done,
Hans, you should have put a rope round the goat’s neck.’ ‘Never mind,
will do better next time.’

‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,
I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to
Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good thing do you
bring?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want something given me.’ Gretel presents
Hans with a piece of bacon. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’

Hans takes the bacon, ties it to a rope, and drags it away behind him.
The dogs come and devour the bacon. When he gets home, he has the rope
in his hand, and there is no longer anything hanging on to it. ‘Good
evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With
Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘I took her nothing, she gave me
something.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a bit of bacon.’ ‘Where
is the bacon, Hans?’ ‘I tied it to a rope, brought it home, dogs took
it.’ ‘That was ill done, Hans, you should have carried the bacon on your
head.’ ‘Never mind, will do better next time.’

‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘I’ll
behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to Gretel.
‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans, What good thing do you bring?’ ‘I
bring nothing, but would have something given.’ Gretel presents Hans
with a calf. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’

Hans takes the calf, puts it on his head, and the calf kicks his face.
‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With
Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘I took nothing, but had something
given me.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘A calf.’ ‘Where have you the
calf, Hans?’ ‘I set it on my head and it kicked my face.’ ‘That was
ill done, Hans, you should have led the calf, and put it in the stall.’
‘Never mind, will do better next time.’

‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘I’ll
behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’

Hans comes to Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good
thing do you bring?’ ‘I bring nothing, but would have something given.’
Gretel says to Hans: ‘I will go with you.’

Hans takes Gretel, ties her to a rope, leads her to the rack, and binds
her fast. Then Hans goes to his mother. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good
evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take
her?’ ‘I took her nothing.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘She gave me
nothing, she came with me.’ ‘Where have you left Gretel?’ ‘I led her by
the rope, tied her to the rack, and scattered some grass for her.’ ‘That
was ill done, Hans, you should have cast friendly eyes on her.’ ‘Never
mind, will do better.’

Hans went into the stable, cut out all the calves’ and sheep’s eyes,
and threw them in Gretel’s face. Then Gretel became angry, tore herself
loose and ran away, and was no longer the bride of Hans.
There was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with
two oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two
talers. When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that
the doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how well he
ate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and would willingly
have been a doctor too. So he remained standing a while, and at length
inquired if he too could not be a doctor. ‘Oh, yes,’ said the doctor,
‘that is soon managed.’ ‘What must I do?’ asked the peasant. ‘In the
first place buy yourself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on
the frontispiece; in the second, turn your cart and your two oxen into
money, and get yourself some clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to
medicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for yourself with the words: “I
am Doctor Knowall,” and have that nailed up above your house-door.’ The
peasant did everything that he had been told to do. When he had doctored
people awhile, but not long, a rich and great lord had some money
stolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such
a village, and must know what had become of the money. So the lord had
the horses harnessed to his carriage, drove out to the village, and
asked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall. Yes, he was, he said. Then he was
to go with him and bring back the stolen money. ‘Oh, yes, but Grete, my
wife, must go too.’ The lord was willing, and let both of them have a
seat in the carriage, and they all drove away together. When they came
to the nobleman’s castle, the table was spread, and Crabb was told to
sit down and eat. ‘Yes, but my wife, Grete, too,’ said he, and he seated
himself with her at the table. And when the first servant came with a
dish of delicate fare, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: ‘Grete,
that was the first,’ meaning that was the servant who brought the first
dish. The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say: ‘That is
the first thief,’ and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said
to his comrade outside: ‘The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he
said I was the first.’ The second did not want to go in at all, but was
forced. So when he went in with his dish, the peasant nudged his wife,
and said: ‘Grete, that is the second.’ This servant was equally alarmed,
and he got out as fast as he could. The third fared no better, for the
peasant again said: ‘Grete, that is the third.’ The fourth had to carry
in a dish that was covered, and the lord told the doctor that he was to
show his skill, and guess what was beneath the cover. Actually, there
were crabs. The doctor looked at the dish, had no idea what to say, and
cried: ‘Ah, poor Crabb.’ When the lord heard that, he cried: ‘There! he
knows it; he must also know who has the money!’

On this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the
doctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When therefore
he went out, all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen
the money, and said that they would willingly restore it and give him a
heavy sum into the bargain, if he would not denounce them, for if he
did they would be hanged. They led him to the spot where the money was
concealed. With this the doctor was satisfied, and returned to the hall,
sat down to the table, and said: ‘My lord, now will I search in my book
where the gold is hidden.’ The fifth servant, however, crept into the
stove to hear if the doctor knew still more. But the doctor sat still
and opened his A B C book, turned the pages backwards and forwards, and
looked for the cock. As he could not find it immediately he said: ‘I
know you are there, so you had better come out!’ Then the fellow in the
stove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out,
crying: ‘That man knows everything!’ Then Doctor Knowall showed the lord
where the money was, but did not say who had stolen it, and received
from both sides much money in reward, and became a renowned man.

There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so
the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he
did spill a little of anything.

Once upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into
partnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well;
they lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add
considerably to their stores. The bird’s duty was to fly daily into the
wood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw
to the cooking.

When people are too well off they always begin to long for something
new. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a
fellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his
household arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a
poor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed
at home and had a good time of it. For, when the mouse had made the fire
and fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest
until it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to watch the
pot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near
dinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out
among the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered,
and salted, and ready to be served. Then, when the bird came home and
had laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had
finished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following
morning: and that was really a very delightful life.

Influenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in
the wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough,
and had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a
change, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and pray
as the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained
master of the situation, and the venture had to be made. They therefore
drew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse
to cook, and to the bird to fetch the water.

And now what happened? The sausage started in search of wood, the bird
made the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited
till the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the
sausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird
flew out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he came across
a dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate
booty, and so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained to the dog
of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for
the dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and
that was the reason his life had been forfeited.

He picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he
had seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the
best of things and to remain with one another.

So now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and,
wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and
out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the
pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having
already parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.

Presently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he
could nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood
here and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to
be found. Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down,
caught fire and began to blaze. The bird hastened to fetch some water,
but his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable
to recover himself, he was drowned.

","There was once a poor man named Hans who lived in a small village. He had a wife and a daughter named Gretel. One day, Hans said to Gretel, 'Whither away, Gretel?' Gretel replied, 'To the forest, father.' Hans said, 'Behave well, Gretel.' 'I will, father,' Gretel said, and she went into the forest.

In the forest, Gretel came across a talking wolf. The wolf said, 'Good day, Gretel. What do you bring me that is good?' Gretel answered, 'I bring you nothing, but I want something given to me.' The wolf gave Gretel a golden apple. 'Goodbye, Gretel,' the wolf said. 'Goodbye, wolf,' Gretel replied, and she went back home.

Hans asked, 'What did you take from the wolf, Gretel?' Gretel showed him the golden apple. Hans said, 'That was ill done, Gretel. You should have taken the wolf's skin and made a coat out of it.' 'Never mind, father,' Gretel said.

The next day, Hans said to Gretel, 'Whither away, Gretel?' Gretel replied, 'To the forest, father.' Hans said, 'Behave well, Gretel.' 'I will, father,' Gretel said, and she went into the forest.

In the forest, Gretel came across the talking wolf again. The wolf said, 'Good day, Gretel. What do you bring me that is good?' Gretel answered, 'I bring you nothing, but I want something given to me.' The wolf gave Gretel a golden necklace. 'Goodbye, Gretel,' the wolf said. 'Goodbye, wolf,' Gretel replied, and she went back home.

Hans asked, 'What did you take from the wolf, Gretel?' Gretel showed him the golden necklace. Hans said, 'That was ill done, Gretel. You should have taken the wolf's eyes and made a pair of spectacles out of them.' 'Never mind, father,' Gretel said.

The next day, Hans said to Gretel, 'Whither away, Gretel?' Gretel replied, 'To the forest, father.' Hans said, 'Behave well, Gretel.' 'I will, father,' Gretel said, and she went into the forest.

In the forest, Gretel came across the talking wolf again. The wolf said, 'Good day, Gretel. What do you bring me that is good?' Gretel answered, 'I bring you nothing, but I want something given to me.' The wolf gave Gretel a golden ring. 'Goodbye, Gretel,' the wolf said. 'Goodbye, wolf,' Gretel replied, and she went back home.

Hans asked, 'What did you take from the wolf, Gretel?' Gretel showed him the golden ring. Hans said, 'That was ill done, Gretel. You should have taken the wolf's teeth and made a comb out of them.' 'Never mind, father,' Gretel said.

The next day, Hans said to Gretel, 'Whither away, Gretel?' Gretel replied, 'To the forest, father.' Hans said, 'Behave well, Gretel.' 'I will, father,' Gretel said, and she went into the forest.

In the forest, Gretel came across the talking wolf again. The wolf said, 'Good day, Gretel. What do you bring me that is good?' Gretel answered, 'I bring you nothing, but I want something given to me.' The wolf said, 'I have nothing left to give you.' Gretel said, 'Then I will take you.' The wolf said, 'Take me if you dare.'

Gretel took hold of the wolf and wrestled with it. The wolf was strong, but Gretel was cunning and quick. She managed to pull out the wolf's teeth and use them to pick locks. With the wolf's teeth, Gretel opened the doors to the castle of a rich king who lived in the forest.

Gretel went into the castle and found the king's treasury. She filled her pockets with gold and jewels and went back home. Hans asked, 'What did you take from the king, Gretel?' Gretel showed him the gold and jewels. Hans said, 'That was well done, Gretel. You have done better than with the wolf.'

From that day on, Gretel and her family lived in wealth and comfort. They never had to worry about money again. And the talking wolf never bothered them again. The End."

A shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old,
and had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wife
were standing together before the house the shepherd said, ‘I will shoot
old Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.’ But his wife
said, ‘Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a
great many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of
his days.’ ‘But what can we do with him?’ said the shepherd, ‘he has not
a tooth in his head, and the thieves don’t care for him at all; to
be sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood;
tomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.’

Poor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd
and his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think
tomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good
friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows,
and how his master meant to kill him in the morning. ‘Make yourself
easy,’ said the wolf, ‘I will give you some good advice. Your master,
you know, goes out every morning very early with his wife into the
field; and they take their little child with them, and lay it down
behind the hedge in the shade while they are at work. Now do you lie
down close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come
out of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as
you can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they
will think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you
that they will take care of you as long as you live.’ The dog liked this
plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed. The wolf ran with the
child a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan
soon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master
and mistress. Then the shepherd patted him on the head, and said, ‘Old
Sultan has saved our child from the wolf, and therefore he shall live
and be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat. Wife, go home, and
give him a good dinner, and let him have my old cushion to sleep on
as long as he lives.’ So from this time forward Sultan had all that he
could wish for.

Soon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, ‘Now, my
good fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way
when I want to taste one of the old shepherd’s fine fat sheep.’ ‘No,’
said the Sultan; ‘I will be true to my master.’ However, the wolf
thought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel. But
Sultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait
for him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for
a good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed
his locks for him finely.

Then the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan ‘an old rogue,’ and
swore he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf sent the
boar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter. Now
Sultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd’s old
three-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped
along with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air.

The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they
espied their enemies coming, and saw the cat’s long tail standing
straight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to
fight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up
a stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of
fighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped
up into a tree. Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked about and
wondered that no one was there. The boar, however, had not quite hidden
himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of
them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a
mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped
up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, ‘Look up in the tree, there
sits the one who is to blame.’ So they looked up, and espied the wolf
sitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal,
and would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of
himself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.
By the side of a wood, in a country a long way off, ran a fine stream
of water; and upon the stream there stood a mill. The miller’s house was
close by, and the miller, you must know, had a very beautiful daughter.
She was, moreover, very shrewd and clever; and the miller was so proud
of her, that he one day told the king of the land, who used to come and
hunt in the wood, that his daughter could spin gold out of straw. Now
this king was very fond of money; and when he heard the miller’s boast
his greediness was raised, and he sent for the girl to be brought before
him. Then he led her to a chamber in his palace where there was a great
heap of straw, and gave her a spinning-wheel, and said, ‘All this must
be spun into gold before morning, as you love your life.’ It was in vain
that the poor maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her father,
for that she could do no such thing as spin straw into gold: the chamber
door was locked, and she was left alone.

She sat down in one corner of the room, and began to bewail her hard
fate; when on a sudden the door opened, and a droll-looking little man
hobbled in, and said, ‘Good morrow to you, my good lass; what are you
weeping for?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘I must spin this straw into gold, and
I know not how.’ ‘What will you give me,’ said the hobgoblin, ‘to do it
for you?’ ‘My necklace,’ replied the maiden. He took her at her word,
and sat himself down to the wheel, and whistled and sang:

 ‘Round about, round about,
    Lo and behold!
  Reel away, reel away,
    Straw into gold!’

And round about the wheel went merrily; the work was quickly done, and
the straw was all spun into gold.

When the king came and saw this, he was greatly astonished and pleased;
but his heart grew still more greedy of gain, and he shut up the poor
miller’s daughter again with a fresh task. Then she knew not what to do,
and sat down once more to weep; but the dwarf soon opened the door, and
said, ‘What will you give me to do your task?’ ‘The ring on my finger,’
said she. So her little friend took the ring, and began to work at the
wheel again, and whistled and sang:

 ‘Round about, round about,
    Lo and behold!
  Reel away, reel away,
    Straw into gold!’

till, long before morning, all was done again.

The king was greatly delighted to see all this glittering treasure;
but still he had not enough: so he took the miller’s daughter to a yet
larger heap, and said, ‘All this must be spun tonight; and if it is,
you shall be my queen.’ As soon as she was alone that dwarf came in, and
said, ‘What will you give me to spin gold for you this third time?’
‘I have nothing left,’ said she. ‘Then say you will give me,’ said
the little man, ‘the first little child that you may have when you are
queen.’ ‘That may never be,’ thought the miller’s daughter: and as she
knew no other way to get her task done, she said she would do what he
asked. Round went the wheel again to the old song, and the manikin once
more spun the heap into gold. The king came in the morning, and, finding
all he wanted, was forced to keep his word; so he married the miller’s
daughter, and she really became queen.

At the birth of her first little child she was very glad, and forgot the
dwarf, and what she had said. But one day he came into her room, where
she was sitting playing with her baby, and put her in mind of it. Then
she grieved sorely at her misfortune, and said she would give him all
the wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off, but in vain; till at
last her tears softened him, and he said, ‘I will give you three days’
grace, and if during that time you tell me my name, you shall keep your
child.’

Now the queen lay awake all night, thinking of all the odd names that
she had ever heard; and she sent messengers all over the land to find
out new ones. The next day the little man came, and she began with
TIMOTHY, ICHABOD, BENJAMIN, JEREMIAH, and all the names she could
remember; but to all and each of them he said, ‘Madam, that is not my
name.’

The second day she began with all the comical names she could hear of,
BANDY-LEGS, HUNCHBACK, CROOK-SHANKS, and so on; but the little gentleman
still said to every one of them, ‘Madam, that is not my name.’

The third day one of the messengers came back, and said, ‘I have
travelled two days without hearing of any other names; but yesterday, as
I was climbing a high hill, among the trees of the forest where the fox
and the hare bid each other good night, I saw a little hut; and before
the hut burnt a fire; and round about the fire a funny little dwarf was
dancing upon one leg, and singing:

 “Merrily the feast I’ll make.
  Today I’ll brew, tomorrow bake;
  Merrily I’ll dance and sing,
  For next day will a stranger bring.
  Little does my lady dream
  Rumpelstiltskin is my name!”

When the queen heard this she jumped for joy, and as soon as her little
friend came she sat down upon her throne, and called all her court round
to enjoy the fun; and the nurse stood by her side with the baby in her
arms, as if it was quite ready to be given up. Then the little man began
to chuckle at the thought of having the poor child, to take home with
him to his hut in the woods; and he cried out, ‘Now, lady, what is my
name?’ ‘Is it JOHN?’ asked she. ‘No, madam!’ ‘Is it TOM?’ ‘No, madam!’
‘Is it JEMMY?’ ‘It is not.’ ‘Can your name be ?’ said the
lady slyly. ‘Some witch told you that!--some witch told you that!’ cried
the little man, and dashed his right foot in a rage so deep into the
floor, that he was forced to lay hold of it with both hands to pull it
out.

Then he made the best of his way off, while the nurse laughed and the
baby crowed; and all the court jeered at him for having had so much
trouble for nothing, and said, ‘We wish you a very good morning, and a
merry feast, Mr RUMPLESTILTSKIN!’
===
Two kings’ sons once upon a time went into the world to seek their
fortunes; but they soon fell into a wasteful foolish way of living, so
that they could not return home again. Then their brother, who was a
little insignificant dwarf, went out to seek for his brothers: but when
he had found them they only laughed at him, to think that he, who was so
young and simple, should try to travel through the world, when they, who
were so much wiser, had been unable to get on. However, they all set
out on their journey together, and came at last to an ant-hill. The two
elder brothers would have pulled it down, in order to see how the poor
ants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs. But the
little dwarf said, ‘Let the poor things enjoy themselves, I will not
suffer you to trouble them.’

So on they went, and came to a lake where many many ducks were swimming
about. The two brothers wanted to catch two, and roast them. But the
dwarf said, ‘Let the poor things enjoy themselves, you shall not kill
them.’ Next they came to a bees’-nest in a hollow tree, and there was
so much honey that it ran down the trunk; and the two brothers wanted to
light a fire under the tree and kill the bees, so as to get their honey.
But the dwarf held them back, and said, ‘Let the pretty insects enjoy
themselves, I cannot let you burn them.’

At length the three brothers came to a castle: and as they passed by the
stables they saw fine horses standing there, but all were of marble, and
no man was to be seen. Then they went through all the rooms, till they
came to a door on which were three locks: but in the middle of the door
was a wicket, so that they could look into the next room. There they saw
a little grey old man sitting at a table; and they called to him once or
twice, but he did not hear: however, they called a third time, and then
he rose and came out to them.

He said nothing, but took hold of them and led them to a beautiful
table covered with all sorts of good things: and when they had eaten and
drunk, he showed each of them to a bed-chamber.

The next morning he came to the eldest and took him to a marble table,
where there were three tablets, containing an account of the means by
which the castle might be disenchanted. The first tablet said: ‘In the
wood, under the moss, lie the thousand pearls belonging to the king’s
daughter; they must all be found: and if one be missing by set of sun,
he who seeks them will be turned into marble.’

The eldest brother set out, and sought for the pearls the whole day:
but the evening came, and he had not found the first hundred: so he was
turned into stone as the tablet had foretold.

The next day the second brother undertook the task; but he succeeded no
better than the first; for he could only find the second hundred of the
pearls; and therefore he too was turned into stone.

At last came the little dwarf’s turn; and he looked in the moss; but it
was so hard to find the pearls, and the job was so tiresome!--so he sat
down upon a stone and cried. And as he sat there, the king of the ants
(whose life he had saved) came to help him, with five thousand ants; and
it was not long before they had found all the pearls and laid them in a
heap.

The second tablet said: ‘The key of the princess’s bed-chamber must be
fished up out of the lake.’ And as the dwarf came to the brink of it,
he saw the two ducks whose lives he had saved swimming about; and they
dived down and soon brought in the key from the bottom.

The third task was the hardest. It was to choose out the youngest and
the best of the king’s three daughters. Now they were all beautiful, and
all exactly alike: but he was told that the eldest had eaten a piece of
sugar, the next some sweet syrup, and the youngest a spoonful of honey;
so he was to guess which it was that had eaten the honey.

Then came the queen of the bees, who had been saved by the little dwarf
from the fire, and she tried the lips of all three; but at last she sat
upon the lips of the one that had eaten the honey: and so the dwarf knew
which was the youngest. Thus the spell was broken, and all who had been
turned into stones awoke, and took their proper forms. And the dwarf
married the youngest and the best of the princesses, and was king after
her father’s death; but his two brothers married the other two sisters.

","In a small village, a cobbler had a loyal dog, named Max, who was growing old and had lost most of his teeth. One day, the cobbler told his wife, ""I will shoot Max tomorrow. He is no use anymore."" But his wife pleaded, ""Let him live, he has served us well for many years. What can we do with him?"" The cobbler sighed, ""What can we do?""

Max, who was nearby, heard their conversation and was frightened. That night, he went to his friend, the fox, and told him about his master's plan. The fox suggested a plan: ""One morning, your master and his wife will take their child to the field. Pretend to guard the child, and I will come and steal it. Run after me and retrieve the child. They will be so grateful, they will take care of you for the rest of your days."" Max agreed and the plan was put into action.

The next morning, the cobbler and his wife took their child to the field. Max lay near the child, and the fox came and attempted to steal the child. Max chased after the fox, retrieved the child, and brought it back to his master and mistress. The cobbler was overjoyed and patted Max on the head, saying, ""Max has saved our child, and he shall live and be well taken care of.""

A few days later, the fox came to Max and asked for his favor. ""I will do anything for you,"" Max replied. The fox said, ""I need your help. The king's men are coming to the village and they will take all our food. Can you help us hide it?"" Max agreed and helped the animals hide their food.

When the king's men arrived, they searched the village but found no food. They were about to leave when the king's dog, a large and fierce hound, began to sniff around. Max, who was watching from a distance, saw the hound approaching the hidden food. He quickly warned the animals, who moved the food to a new location.

The hound, not finding the food, reported back to the king's men. The king, angry at the loss of food, ordered the men to search the village again. This time, they found nothing. The king, frustrated, decided to burn the village to the ground.

Max, seeing the smoke and flames, ran to the village and found the animals in chaos. He quickly gathered them and led them to safety. The king's men, seeing the animals escaping, followed them. Max, using his cunning, led them on a wild goose chase through the forest, losing them in the process.

The animals returned to the village and found it destroyed. Max, however, had saved their lives. The animals, grateful for Max's bravery, offered him a reward. Max declined, saying, ""I have been rewarded enough by your friendship."" And so, Max lived out the rest of his days in the forest, surrounded by his loyal animal friends.

There was once a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run
alone. One day the child was very troublesome, and the mother could not
quiet it, do what she would. She grew impatient, and seeing the ravens
flying round the castle, she opened the window, and said: ‘I wish you
were a raven and would fly away, then I should have a little peace.’
Scarcely were the words out of her mouth, when the child in her arms was
turned into a raven, and flew away from her through the open window. The
bird took its flight to a dark wood and remained there for a long time,
and meanwhile the parents could hear nothing of their child.

Long after this, a man was making his way through the wood when he heard
a raven calling, and he followed the sound of the voice. As he drew
near, the raven said, ‘I am by birth a king’s daughter, but am now under
the spell of some enchantment; you can, however, set me free.’ ‘What
am I to do?’ he asked. She replied, ‘Go farther into the wood until you
come to a house, wherein lives an old woman; she will offer you food and
drink, but you must not take of either; if you do, you will fall into
a deep sleep, and will not be able to help me. In the garden behind the
house is a large tan-heap, and on that you must stand and watch for me.
I shall drive there in my carriage at two o’clock in the afternoon for
three successive days; the first day it will be drawn by four white, the
second by four chestnut, and the last by four black horses; but if you
fail to keep awake and I find you sleeping, I shall not be set free.’

The man promised to do all that she wished, but the raven said, ‘Alas! I
know even now that you will take something from the woman and be unable
to save me.’ The man assured her again that he would on no account touch
a thing to eat or drink.

When he came to the house and went inside, the old woman met him, and
said, ‘Poor man! how tired you are! Come in and rest and let me give you
something to eat and drink.’

‘No,’ answered the man, ‘I will neither eat not drink.’

But she would not leave him alone, and urged him saying, ‘If you will
not eat anything, at least you might take a draught of wine; one drink
counts for nothing,’ and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded, and
drank.

As it drew towards the appointed hour, he went outside into the garden
and mounted the tan-heap to await the raven. Suddenly a feeling of
fatigue came over him, and unable to resist it, he lay down for a little
while, fully determined, however, to keep awake; but in another minute
his eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell into such a deep sleep,
that all the noises in the world would not have awakened him. At two
o’clock the raven came driving along, drawn by her four white horses;
but even before she reached the spot, she said to herself, sighing, ‘I
know he has fallen asleep.’ When she entered the garden, there she found
him as she had feared, lying on the tan-heap, fast asleep. She got out
of her carriage and went to him; she called him and shook him, but it
was all in vain, he still continued sleeping.

The next day at noon, the old woman came to him again with food and
drink which he at first refused. At last, overcome by her persistent
entreaties that he would take something, he lifted the glass and drank
again.

Towards two o’clock he went into the garden and on to the tan-heap to
watch for the raven. He had not been there long before he began to feel
so tired that his limbs seemed hardly able to support him, and he could
not stand upright any longer; so again he lay down and fell fast asleep.
As the raven drove along her four chestnut horses, she said sorrowfully
to herself, ‘I know he has fallen asleep.’ She went as before to look
for him, but he slept, and it was impossible to awaken him.

The following day the old woman said to him, ‘What is this? You are not
eating or drinking anything, do you want to kill yourself?’

He answered, ‘I may not and will not either eat or drink.’

But she put down the dish of food and the glass of wine in front of him,
and when he smelt the wine, he was unable to resist the temptation, and
took a deep draught.

When the hour came round again he went as usual on to the tan-heap in
the garden to await the king’s daughter, but he felt even more overcome
with weariness than on the two previous days, and throwing himself down,
he slept like a log. At two o’clock the raven could be seen approaching,
and this time her coachman and everything about her, as well as her
horses, were black.

She was sadder than ever as she drove along, and said mournfully, ‘I
know he has fallen asleep, and will not be able to set me free.’ She
found him sleeping heavily, and all her efforts to awaken him were of no
avail. Then she placed beside him a loaf, and some meat, and a flask
of wine, of such a kind, that however much he took of them, they would
never grow less. After that she drew a gold ring, on which her name was
engraved, off her finger, and put it upon one of his. Finally, she laid
a letter near him, in which, after giving him particulars of the food
and drink she had left for him, she finished with the following words:
‘I see that as long as you remain here you will never be able to set me
free; if, however, you still wish to do so, come to the golden castle
of Stromberg; this is well within your power to accomplish.’ She then
returned to her carriage and drove to the golden castle of Stromberg.

When the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping, he was grieved
at heart, and said, ‘She has no doubt been here and driven away again,
and it is now too late for me to save her.’ Then his eyes fell on the
things which were lying beside him; he read the letter, and knew from it
all that had happened. He rose up without delay, eager to start on his
way and to reach the castle of Stromberg, but he had no idea in which
direction he ought to go. He travelled about a long time in search of it
and came at last to a dark forest, through which he went on walking for
fourteen days and still could not find a way out. Once more the night
came on, and worn out he lay down under a bush and fell asleep. Again
the next day he pursued his way through the forest, and that evening,
thinking to rest again, he lay down as before, but he heard such a
howling and wailing that he found it impossible to sleep. He waited till
it was darker and people had begun to light up their houses, and then
seeing a little glimmer ahead of him, he went towards it.

He found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than
it really was, from the contrast of its height with that of an immense
giant who stood in front of it. He thought to himself, ‘If the giant
sees me going in, my life will not be worth much.’ However, after a
while he summoned up courage and went forward. When the giant saw him,
he called out, ‘It is lucky for that you have come, for I have not had
anything to eat for a long time. I can have you now for my supper.’ ‘I
would rather you let that alone,’ said the man, ‘for I do not willingly
give myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food I have enough to
satisfy your hunger.’ ‘If that is so,’ replied the giant, ‘I will leave
you in peace; I only thought of eating you because I had nothing else.’

So they went indoors together and sat down, and the man brought out the
bread, meat, and wine, which although he had eaten and drunk of them,
were still unconsumed. The giant was pleased with the good cheer, and
ate and drank to his heart’s content. When he had finished his supper
the man asked him if he could direct him to the castle of Stromberg.
The giant said, ‘I will look on my map; on it are marked all the towns,
villages, and houses.’ So he fetched his map, and looked for the castle,
but could not find it. ‘Never mind,’ he said, ‘I have larger maps
upstairs in the cupboard, we will look on those,’ but they searched in
vain, for the castle was not marked even on these. The man now thought
he should like to continue his journey, but the giant begged him to
remain for a day or two longer until the return of his brother, who was
away in search of provisions. When the brother came home, they asked him
about the castle of Stromberg, and he told them he would look on his own
maps as soon as he had eaten and appeased his hunger. Accordingly, when
he had finished his supper, they all went up together to his room and
looked through his maps, but the castle was not to be found. Then he
fetched other older maps, and they went on looking for the castle until
at last they found it, but it was many thousand miles away. ‘How shall I
be able to get there?’ asked the man. ‘I have two hours to spare,’ said
the giant, ‘and I will carry you into the neighbourhood of the castle; I
must then return to look after the child who is in our care.’

The giant, thereupon, carried the man to within about a hundred leagues
of the castle, where he left him, saying, ‘You will be able to walk the
remainder of the way yourself.’ The man journeyed on day and night
till he reached the golden castle of Stromberg. He found it situated,
however, on a glass mountain, and looking up from the foot he saw the
enchanted maiden drive round her castle and then go inside. He was
overjoyed to see her, and longed to get to the top of the mountain, but
the sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climb he
fell back again. When he saw that it was impossible to reach her, he was
greatly grieved, and said to himself, ‘I will remain here and wait for
her,’ so he built himself a little hut, and there he sat and watched for
a whole year, and every day he saw the king’s daughter driving round her
castle, but still was unable to get nearer to her.

Looking out from his hut one day he saw three robbers fighting and he
called out to them, ‘God be with you.’ They stopped when they heard the
call, but looking round and seeing nobody, they went on again with their
fighting, which now became more furious. ‘God be with you,’ he cried
again, and again they paused and looked about, but seeing no one went
back to their fighting. A third time he called out, ‘God be with you,’
and then thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute between
the three men, he went out and asked them why they were fighting so
angrily with one another. One of them said that he had found a stick,
and that he had but to strike it against any door through which he
wished to pass, and it immediately flew open. Another told him that he
had found a cloak which rendered its wearer invisible; and the third had
caught a horse which would carry its rider over any obstacle, and even
up the glass mountain. They had been unable to decide whether they
would keep together and have the things in common, or whether they would
separate. On hearing this, the man said, ‘I will give you something in
exchange for those three things; not money, for that I have not got,
but something that is of far more value. I must first, however, prove
whether all you have told me about your three things is true.’ The
robbers, therefore, made him get on the horse, and handed him the stick
and the cloak, and when he had put this round him he was no longer
visible. Then he fell upon them with the stick and beat them one after
another, crying, ‘There, you idle vagabonds, you have got what you
deserve; are you satisfied now!’

After this he rode up the glass mountain. When he reached the gate of
the castle, he found it closed, but he gave it a blow with his stick,
and it flew wide open at once and he passed through. He mounted the
steps and entered the room where the maiden was sitting, with a golden
goblet full of wine in front of her. She could not see him for he still
wore his cloak. He took the ring which she had given him off his finger,
and threw it into the goblet, so that it rang as it touched the bottom.
‘That is my own ring,’ she exclaimed, ‘and if that is so the man must
also be here who is coming to set me free.’

She sought for him about the castle, but could find him nowhere.
Meanwhile he had gone outside again and mounted his horse and thrown off
the cloak. When therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him, and
cried aloud for joy. Then he dismounted and took her in his arms; and
she kissed him, and said, ‘Now you have indeed set me free, and tomorrow
we will celebrate our marriage.’
There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so
the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he
did spill a little of anything.

","Once upon a time, there was a king who had a beautiful daughter, but she was cursed to be a frog. One day, a young man was walking through the forest when he heard a frog croaking. He approached and saw it was the king's daughter.

""I am under a spell,"" she said. ""A witch cast a curse upon me, and I can only be returned to my human form if a brave man can find the witch's house and retrieve a golden apple from her garden.""

The young man promised to help her, and she told him to follow the sound of the river until he came to a dark forest. There, he would find a small cottage where an old woman lived. She would offer him food and drink, but he must not take anything, or he would fall into a deep sleep and be unable to help the princess.

The young man followed the river and found the cottage. The old woman offered him food and drink, but he refused. She persisted, and he finally took a sip of wine. As he sat down to rest, he felt his eyes growing heavy. He tried to stay awake, but soon fell into a deep sleep.

The next day, he awoke and continued his journey. He came to the cottage again, and this time the old woman offered him a piece of bread and a glass of water. He refused, but she insisted. He took a sip of water, and again fell into a deep sleep.

On the third day, he awoke and went to the cottage one last time. The old woman offered him a slice of cheese and a cup of tea. He refused, but she insisted. He took a sip of tea, and this time he felt a strange warmth in his chest. He knew he would not fall asleep this time.

He followed the sound of the river until he came to a large, dark forest. He walked for hours until he came to a clearing, where he saw a beautiful garden surrounded by a high wall. In the center of the garden was a large apple tree, and hanging from one of the branches was a golden apple.

The young man climbed the wall and reached for the apple, but just as he was about to take it, he heard a voice behind him.

""You have come far, young man,"" said the witch. ""But you will never leave this garden alive.""

The young man turned and saw the witch standing behind him, her eyes glowing red.

""I have a proposition for you,"" she said. ""I will let you leave this garden with the golden apple if you promise to bring me the heart of the king's daughter.""

The young man was horrified. He had promised the princess he would save her, not betray her.

""I will never betray the princess,"" he said. ""I will fight you to the death if that is what it takes.""

The witch laughed. ""Very well,"" she said. ""But remember, I am a powerful witch, and I will not go easy on you.""

The young man drew his sword and charged at the witch. They fought for hours, but the young man was stronger and more determined. Finally, he struck the witch down and took the golden apple.

He climbed the wall and ran back to the princess, who was waiting for him. She was overjoyed to see him, and he gave her the golden apple.

""Now, my love,"" he said, ""we must return to the castle and break the spell.""

They walked back to the castle, and the princess held the golden apple high. The king was overjoyed to see his daughter returned to her human form, and the young man was hailed as a hero.

They were married that very day, and the princess never forgot the brave young man who had saved her from a life as a frog.

There was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest:
but still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he
had in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of
shoes.

Then he cut his leather out, all ready to make up the next day, meaning
to rise early in the morning to his work. His conscience was clear and
his heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed,
left all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep. In the morning after
he had said his prayers, he sat himself down to his work; when, to his
great wonder, there stood the shoes all ready made, upon the table. The
good man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening.
He looked at the workmanship; there was not one false stitch in the
whole job; all was so neat and true, that it was quite a masterpiece.

The same day a customer came in, and the shoes suited him so well that
he willingly paid a price higher than usual for them; and the poor
shoemaker, with the money, bought leather enough to make two pairs more.
In the evening he cut out the work, and went to bed early, that he might
get up and begin betimes next day; but he was saved all the trouble, for
when he got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand. Soon
in came buyers, who paid him handsomely for his goods, so that he bought
leather enough for four pair more. He cut out the work again overnight
and found it done in the morning, as before; and so it went on for some
time: what was got ready in the evening was always done by daybreak, and
the good man soon became thriving and well off again.

One evening, about Christmas-time, as he and his wife were sitting over
the fire chatting together, he said to her, ‘I should like to sit up and
watch tonight, that we may see who it is that comes and does my work for
me.’ The wife liked the thought; so they left a light burning, and hid
themselves in a corner of the room, behind a curtain that was hung up
there, and watched what would happen.

As soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs; and
they sat themselves upon the shoemaker’s bench, took up all the work
that was cut out, and began to ply with their little fingers, stitching
and rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that the shoemaker was all
wonder, and could not take his eyes off them. And on they went, till the
job was quite done, and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table.
This was long before daybreak; and then they bustled away as quick as
lightning.

The next day the wife said to the shoemaker. ‘These little wights have
made us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them a good
turn if we can. I am quite sorry to see them run about as they do; and
indeed it is not very decent, for they have nothing upon their backs to
keep off the cold. I’ll tell you what, I will make each of them a shirt,
and a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain; and
do you make each of them a little pair of shoes.’

The thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening, when
all the things were ready, they laid them on the table, instead of the
work that they used to cut out, and then went and hid themselves, to
watch what the little elves would do.

About midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the
room, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they
saw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed
mightily delighted.

Then they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and danced and
capered and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at last they danced
out at the door, and away over the green.

The good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them
from that time forward, as long as they lived.
A shepherd’s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him
suffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he
took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood.
On the road he met a sparrow that said to him, ‘Why are you so sad,
my friend?’ ‘Because,’ said the dog, ‘I am very very hungry, and have
nothing to eat.’ ‘If that be all,’ answered the sparrow, ‘come with me
into the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.’ So on they
went together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher’s shop,
the sparrow said to the dog, ‘Stand there a little while till I peck you
down a piece of meat.’ So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having
first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she
pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf,
till at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up, and scrambled
away with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up. ‘Well,’ said
the sparrow, ‘you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to
the next shop, and I will peck you down another steak.’ When the dog had
eaten this too, the sparrow said to him, ‘Well, my good friend, have you
had enough now?’ ‘I have had plenty of meat,’ answered he, ‘but I should
like to have a piece of bread to eat after it.’ ‘Come with me then,’
said the sparrow, ‘and you shall soon have that too.’ So she took him
to a baker’s shop, and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window, till
they fell down: and as the dog still wished for more, she took him to
another shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten, the
sparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. ‘Yes,’ said he; ‘and
now let us take a walk a little way out of the town.’ So they both went
out upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone
far before the dog said, ‘I am very much tired--I should like to take a
nap.’ ‘Very well,’ answered the sparrow, ‘do so, and in the meantime
I will perch upon that bush.’ So the dog stretched himself out on the
road, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with
a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. The
sparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would
go on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called
out, ‘Stop! stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.’ But the
carter, grumbling to himself, ‘You make it the worse for me, indeed!
what can you do?’ cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor
dog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. ‘There,’ cried the
sparrow, ‘thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now
mind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.’
‘Do your worst, and welcome,’ said the brute, ‘what harm can you do me?’
and passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and
pecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and then
all the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it. At last he looked
round, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty.
‘What an unlucky wretch I am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said
the sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses, and
pecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the carter saw this,
he drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill
her; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horse’s head
with such force, that he fell down dead. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’
cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the sparrow. And as the carter
went on with the other two horses, she again crept under the tilt of the
cart, and pecked out the bung of the second cask, so that all the wine
ran out. When the carter saw this, he again cried out, ‘Miserable wretch
that I am!’ But the sparrow answered, ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ and
perched on the head of the second horse, and pecked at him too. The
carter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she
flew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the
spot. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ said he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said
the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him
too. The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or
caring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his
third horse as he done the other two. ‘Alas! miserable wretch that I
am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ answered the sparrow as she flew
away; ‘now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.’ The
carter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home
overflowing with rage and vexation. ‘Alas!’ said he to his wife, ‘what
ill luck has befallen me!--my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three
dead.’ ‘Alas! husband,’ replied she, ‘and a wicked bird has come into
the house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am
sure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it
up at such a rate!’ Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of
birds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the
midst of them. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ cried the carter; for he saw
that the corn was almost all gone. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the
sparrow; ‘thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life yet!’ and away she flew.

The carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down
into his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat
himself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow sat
on the outside of the window, and cried ‘Carter! thy cruelty shall cost
thee thy life!’ With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet,
and threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the
window. The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window-seat, and
cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!’ Then he became mad and
blind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he
cleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter
and his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture,
glasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without
touching the bird at all. In the end, however, they caught her: and the
wife said, ‘Shall I kill her at once?’ ‘No,’ cried he, ‘that is letting
her off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat
her.’ But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck
and cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!’ With that he
could wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, ‘Wife,
strike at the bird and kill her in my hand.’ And the wife struck; but
she missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down
dead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.

Once upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into
partnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well;
they lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add
considerably to their stores. The bird’s duty was to fly daily into the
wood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw
to the cooking.

When people are too well off they always begin to long for something
new. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a
fellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his
household arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a
poor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed
at home and had a good time of it. For, when the mouse had made the fire
and fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest
until it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to watch the
pot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near
dinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out
among the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered,
and salted, and ready to be served. Then, when the bird came home and
had laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had
finished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following
morning: and that was really a very delightful life.

Influenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in
the wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough,
and had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a
change, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and pray
as the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained
master of the situation, and the venture had to be made. They therefore
drew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse
to cook, and to the bird to fetch the water.

And now what happened? The sausage started in search of wood, the bird
made the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited
till the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the
sausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird
flew out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he came across
a dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate
booty, and so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained to the dog
of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for
the dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and
that was the reason his life had been forfeited.

He picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he
had seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the
best of things and to remain with one another.

So now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and,
wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and
out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the
pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having
already parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.

Presently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he
could nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood
here and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to
be found. Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down,
caught fire and began to blaze. The bird hastened to fetch some water,
but his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable
to recover himself, he was drowned.

","In a small village, there lived a tailor who was known for his skill and honesty. Despite his hard work, he struggled to make ends meet. One day, he had only enough fabric left to make one coat. He cut it out and went to bed, hoping to finish it the next day.

As he slept, he heard a rustling sound. To his surprise, three tiny elves appeared in his workshop. They sat down at his sewing machine and began to work with incredible speed. By morning, the coat was finished, and it was of the finest quality. The tailor was amazed and grateful.

From that day on, every night the elves would come and finish his work. His business flourished, and he became wealthy. One evening, the tailor and his wife decided to watch and see who the elves were. They hid behind a curtain and watched as the elves worked.

When they finished, the tailor's wife spoke up. ""These little beings have brought us success, and we should be grateful. I will make each of them a set of clothes as a thank you."" The next day, she presented the elves with beautiful clothes. They thanked her and danced away, leaving the tailor and his wife richer than ever.

One winter evening, the tailor and his wife decided to invite the elves to dinner. They set a place for them at the table and waited. The elves arrived and ate heartily. After dinner, they danced and sang, filling the house with joy.

The next morning, the tailor woke up to find his workshop empty. He searched everywhere, but the elves were gone. Days turned into weeks, and the tailor and his wife missed their tiny friends. One day, the tailor received a letter. It was from the elves, thanking him for his kindness and telling him that they had moved on to help others.

The tailor and his wife were sad, but they were also grateful for the time they had spent with the elves. They continued to prosper, and they never forgot the little beings who had helped them.

There was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and
when she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that,
was quite happy and thought: ‘You certainly are a pretty girl!’ And when
she came home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught of wine,
and as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever she
was cooking until she was satisfied, and said: ‘The cook must know what
the food is like.’

It came to pass that the master one day said to her: ‘Gretel, there is a
guest coming this evening; prepare me two fowls very daintily.’ ‘I will
see to it, master,’ answered Gretel. She killed two fowls, scalded them,
plucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before
the fire, that they might roast. The fowls began to turn brown, and were
nearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived. Then Gretel called out
to her master: ‘If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away
from the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten
the moment they are at their juiciest.’ The master said: ‘I will run
myself, and fetch the guest.’ When the master had turned his back,
Gretel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and thought: ‘Standing
so long by the fire there, makes one sweat and thirsty; who knows
when they will come? Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a
drink.’ She ran down, set a jug, said: ‘God bless it for you, Gretel,’
and took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should
not be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught.

Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them,
and drove the spit merrily round. But as the roast meat smelt so good,
Gretel thought: ‘Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!’
She touched it with her finger, and said: ‘Ah! how good fowls are! It
certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right
time!’ She ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with
his guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the fowls and thought:
‘One of the wings is burning! I had better take it off and eat it.’
So she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she
thought: ‘The other must go down too, or else master will observe that
something is missing.’ When the two wings were eaten, she went and
looked for her master, and did not see him. It suddenly occurred to
her: ‘Who knows? They are perhaps not coming at all, and have turned in
somewhere.’ Then she said: ‘Well, Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has
been cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is
eaten you will have some peace, why should God’s good gifts be spoilt?’
So she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the
one chicken in great glee. When one of the chickens was swallowed down,
and still her master did not come, Gretel looked at the other and said:
‘What one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what’s
right for the one is right for the other; I think if I were to take
another draught it would do me no harm.’ So she took another hearty
drink, and let the second chicken follow the first.

While she was making the most of it, her master came and cried: ‘Hurry
up, Gretel, the guest is coming directly after me!’ ‘Yes, sir, I will
soon serve up,’ answered Gretel. Meantime the master looked to see that
the table was properly laid, and took the great knife, wherewith he was
going to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on the steps. Presently
the guest came, and knocked politely and courteously at the house-door.
Gretel ran, and looked to see who was there, and when she saw the guest,
she put her finger to her lips and said: ‘Hush! hush! go away as quickly
as you can, if my master catches you it will be the worse for you; he
certainly did ask you to supper, but his intention is to cut off your
two ears. Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!’ The guest
heard the sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he
could. Gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried:
‘You have invited a fine guest!’ ‘Why, Gretel? What do you mean by
that?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘he has taken the chickens which I was just
going to serve up, off the dish, and has run away with them!’ ‘That’s a
nice trick!’ said her master, and lamented the fine chickens. ‘If he had
but left me one, so that something remained for me to eat.’ He called to
him to stop, but the guest pretended not to hear. Then he ran after him
with the knife still in his hand, crying: ‘Just one, just one,’ meaning
that the guest should leave him just one chicken, and not take both. The
guest, however, thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of
his ears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take
them both with him.
An honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant to him
a great many years, but was now growing old and every day more and more
unfit for work. His master therefore was tired of keeping him and
began to think of putting an end to him; but the ass, who saw that some
mischief was in the wind, took himself slyly off, and began his journey
towards the great city, ‘For there,’ thought he, ‘I may turn musician.’

After he had travelled a little way, he spied a dog lying by the
roadside and panting as if he were tired. ‘What makes you pant so, my
friend?’ said the ass. ‘Alas!’ said the dog, ‘my master was going to
knock me on the head, because I am old and weak, and can no longer make
myself useful to him in hunting; so I ran away; but what can I do to
earn my livelihood?’ ‘Hark ye!’ said the ass, ‘I am going to the great
city to turn musician: suppose you go with me, and try what you can
do in the same way?’ The dog said he was willing, and they jogged on
together.

They had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the
road and making a most rueful face. ‘Pray, my good lady,’ said the ass,
‘what’s the matter with you? You look quite out of spirits!’ ‘Ah, me!’
said the cat, ‘how can one be in good spirits when one’s life is in
danger? Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my
ease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress
laid hold of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky
enough to get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon.’
‘Oh,’ said the ass, ‘by all means go with us to the great city; you are
a good night singer, and may make your fortune as a musician.’ The cat
was pleased with the thought, and joined the party.

Soon afterwards, as they were passing by a farmyard, they saw a cock
perched upon a gate, and screaming out with all his might and main.
‘Bravo!’ said the ass; ‘upon my word, you make a famous noise; pray what
is all this about?’ ‘Why,’ said the cock, ‘I was just now saying that
we should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my mistress and
the cook don’t thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut off my
head tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are coming
on Sunday!’ ‘Heaven forbid!’ said the ass, ‘come with us Master
Chanticleer; it will be better, at any rate, than staying here to have
your head cut off! Besides, who knows? If we care to sing in tune, we
may get up some kind of a concert; so come along with us.’ ‘With all my
heart,’ said the cock: so they all four went on jollily together.

They could not, however, reach the great city the first day; so when
night came on, they went into a wood to sleep. The ass and the dog laid
themselves down under a great tree, and the cat climbed up into the
branches; while the cock, thinking that the higher he sat the safer he
should be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and then, according to
his custom, before he went to sleep, looked out on all sides of him to
see that everything was well. In doing this, he saw afar off something
bright and shining and calling to his companions said, ‘There must be a
house no great way off, for I see a light.’ ‘If that be the case,’ said
the ass, ‘we had better change our quarters, for our lodging is not the
best in the world!’ ‘Besides,’ added the dog, ‘I should not be the
worse for a bone or two, or a bit of meat.’ So they walked off together
towards the spot where Chanticleer had seen the light, and as they drew
near it became larger and brighter, till they at last came close to a
house in which a gang of robbers lived.

The ass, being the tallest of the company, marched up to the window and
peeped in. ‘Well, Donkey,’ said Chanticleer, ‘what do you see?’ ‘What
do I see?’ replied the ass. ‘Why, I see a table spread with all kinds of
good things, and robbers sitting round it making merry.’ ‘That would
be a noble lodging for us,’ said the cock. ‘Yes,’ said the ass, ‘if we
could only get in’; so they consulted together how they should contrive
to get the robbers out; and at last they hit upon a plan. The ass placed
himself upright on his hind legs, with his forefeet resting against the
window; the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the dog’s
shoulders, and the cock flew up and sat upon the cat’s head. When
all was ready a signal was given, and they began their music. The ass
brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock screamed; and then
they all broke through the window at once, and came tumbling into
the room, amongst the broken glass, with a most hideous clatter! The
robbers, who had been not a little frightened by the opening concert,
had now no doubt that some frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon them,
and scampered away as fast as they could.

The coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what
the robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not expected
to eat again for a month. As soon as they had satisfied themselves, they
put out the lights, and each once more sought out a resting-place to
his own liking. The donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in
the yard, the dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door, the
cat rolled herself up on the hearth before the warm ashes, and the
cock perched upon a beam on the top of the house; and, as they were all
rather tired with their journey, they soon fell asleep.

But about midnight, when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were
out and that all seemed quiet, they began to think that they had been in
too great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was bolder than
the rest, went to see what was going on. Finding everything still, he
marched into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a match in
order to light a candle; and then, espying the glittering fiery eyes of
the cat, he mistook them for live coals, and held the match to them to
light it. But the cat, not understanding this joke, sprang at his face,
and spat, and scratched at him. This frightened him dreadfully, and away
he ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the
leg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the
cock, who had been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might. At
this the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told
the captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at
him and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a
knife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him
in the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a
club, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out,
‘Throw the rascal up here!’ After this the robbers never dared to go
back to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters
that they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at
this very day.

There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so
the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he
did spill a little of anything.

It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to
herself: ‘He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the
world,’ she spoke to him in a friendly way. ‘Good day, dear Mr Fox,
how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard
times?’ The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from
head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give
any answer or not. At last he said: ‘Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you
piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have
you the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How
many arts do you understand?’ ‘I understand but one,’ replied the
cat, modestly. ‘What art is that?’ asked the fox. ‘When the hounds are
following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.’ ‘Is that all?’
said the fox. ‘I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain
a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will
teach you how people get away from the hounds.’ Just then came a hunter
with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top
of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. ‘Open your
sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,’ cried the cat to him, but the dogs had
already seized him, and were holding him fast. ‘Ah, Mr Fox,’ cried the
cat. ‘You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been
able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.’

","Once upon a time, there was a baker named Hans, who wore shoes with brown leather, and when he walked out with them on, he turned himself this way and that, was quite happy and thought: ‘You certainly are a hardworking man!’ And when he came home he drank, in his gladness of heart, a draught of beer, and as beer excites a desire to eat, he tasted the best of whatever he was baking until he was satisfied, and said: ‘The baker must know what the bread is like.’

It came to pass that the mayor one day said to him: ‘Hans, there is a guest coming this evening; bake me two loaves of bread very nicely.’ ‘I will see to it, mayor,’ answered Hans. He kneaded the dough, let it rise, shaped the loaves, and towards evening set them in the oven, that they might bake. The bread began to turn golden, and were nearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived. Then Hans called out to his mayor: ‘If the guest does not come, I must take the bread away from the oven, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten the moment they are at their best.’ The mayor said: ‘I will run myself, and fetch the guest.’ When the mayor had turned his back, Hans laid the bread on one side, and thought: ‘Standing so long by the oven there, makes one sweat and thirsty; who knows when they will come?

But as the freshly baked bread smelled so good, Hans thought: ‘Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!’ He touched it with his finger, and said: ‘Ah! how good bread is! It certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right time!’ He ran to the window, to see if the mayor was not coming with his guest, but he saw no one, and went back to the bread and thought: ‘One loaf is burning!

the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he
did spill a little of anything.
There was once a man who had seven sons, and last of all one daughter.
Although the little girl was very pretty, she was so weak and small that
they thought she could not live; but they said she should at once be
christened.

So the father sent one of his sons in haste to the spring to get some
water, but the other six ran with him. Each wanted to be first at
drawing the water, and so they were in such a hurry that all let their
pitchers fall into the well, and they stood very foolishly looking at
one another, and did not know what to do, for none dared go home. In the
meantime the father was uneasy, and could not tell what made the
young men stay so long. ‘Surely,’ said he, ‘the whole seven must have
forgotten themselves over some game of play’; and when he had waited
still longer and they yet did not come, he flew into a rage and wished
them all turned into ravens. Scarcely had he spoken these words when he
heard a croaking over his head, and looked up and saw seven ravens as
black as coal flying round and round. Sorry as he was to see his wish
so fulfilled, he did not know how what was done could be undone, and
comforted himself as well as he could for the loss of his seven sons
with his dear little daughter, who soon became stronger and every day
more beautiful.

For a long time she did not know that she had ever had any brothers; for
her father and mother took care not to speak of them before her: but one
day by chance she heard the people about her speak of them. ‘Yes,’ said
they, ‘she is beautiful indeed, but still ‘tis a pity that her brothers
should have been lost for her sake.’ Then she was much grieved, and went
to her father and mother, and asked if she had any brothers, and what
had become of them. So they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but
said it was the will of Heaven, and that her birth was only the innocent
cause of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day, and
thought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back;
and she had neither rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole
away, and set out into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever
they might be, and free them, whatever it might cost her.

She took nothing with her but a little ring which her father and mother
had given her, a loaf of bread in case she should be hungry, a little
pitcher of water in case she should be thirsty, and a little stool
to rest upon when she should be weary. Thus she went on and on, and
journeyed till she came to the world’s end; then she came to the sun,
but the sun looked much too hot and fiery; so she ran away quickly to
the moon, but the moon was cold and chilly, and said, ‘I smell flesh
and blood this way!’ so she took herself away in a hurry and came to the
stars, and the stars were friendly and kind to her, and each star sat
upon his own little stool; but the morning star rose up and gave her a
little piece of wood, and said, ‘If you have not this little piece of
wood, you cannot unlock the castle that stands on the glass-mountain,
and there your brothers live.’ The little girl took the piece of wood,
rolled it up in a little cloth, and went on again until she came to the
glass-mountain, and found the door shut. Then she felt for the little
piece of wood; but when she unwrapped the cloth it was not there, and
she saw she had lost the gift of the good stars. What was to be done?
She wanted to save her brothers, and had no key of the castle of the
glass-mountain; so this faithful little sister took a knife out of her
pocket and cut off her little finger, that was just the size of the
piece of wood she had lost, and put it in the door and opened it.

As she went in, a little dwarf came up to her, and said, ‘What are you
seeking for?’ ‘I seek for my brothers, the seven ravens,’ answered she.
Then the dwarf said, ‘My masters are not at home; but if you will wait
till they come, pray step in.’ Now the little dwarf was getting their
dinner ready, and he brought their food upon seven little plates, and
their drink in seven little glasses, and set them upon the table, and
out of each little plate their sister ate a small piece, and out of each
little glass she drank a small drop; but she let the ring that she had
brought with her fall into the last glass.

On a sudden she heard a fluttering and croaking in the air, and the
dwarf said, ‘Here come my masters.’ When they came in, they wanted to
eat and drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses. Then said
one after the other,

‘Who has eaten from my little plate? And who has been drinking out of my
little glass?’

 ‘Caw! Caw! well I ween
  Mortal lips have this way been.’

When the seventh came to the bottom of his glass, and found there the
ring, he looked at it, and knew that it was his father’s and mother’s,
and said, ‘O that our little sister would but come! then we should be
free.’ When the little girl heard this (for she stood behind the door
all the time and listened), she ran forward, and in an instant all
the ravens took their right form again; and all hugged and kissed each
other, and went merrily home.

A certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much
to her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at
length the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.
‘But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer
from hunger,’ said the cat; ‘and you, little mouse, cannot venture
everywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.’ The good advice
was followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where
to put it. At length, after much consideration, the cat said: ‘I know no
place where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one
dares take anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar,
and not touch it until we are really in need of it.’ So the pot was
placed in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great
yearning for it, and said to the mouse: ‘I want to tell you something,
little mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has
asked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold
him over the font at the christening. Let me go out today, and you look
after the house by yourself.’ ‘Yes, yes,’ answered the mouse, ‘by all
means go, and if you get anything very good to eat, think of me. I
should like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.’ All this,
however, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to
be godmother. She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat,
began to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off. Then she took a
walk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then
stretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought
of the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home.
‘Well, here you are again,’ said the mouse, ‘no doubt you have had a
merry day.’ ‘All went off well,’ answered the cat. ‘What name did they
give the child?’ ‘Top off!’ said the cat quite coolly. ‘Top off!’ cried
the mouse, ‘that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in
your family?’ ‘What does that matter,’ said the cat, ‘it is no worse
than Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.’

Before long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She said to
the mouse: ‘You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for
a day alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a
white ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.’ The good mouse consented,
but the cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured
half the pot of fat. ‘Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to
oneself,’ said she, and was quite satisfied with her day’s work. When
she went home the mouse inquired: ‘And what was the child christened?’
‘Half-done,’ answered the cat. ‘Half-done! What are you saying? I
never heard the name in my life, I’ll wager anything it is not in the
calendar!’

The cat’s mouth soon began to water for some more licking. ‘All good
things go in threes,’ said she, ‘I am asked to stand godmother again.
The child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that
exception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only
happens once every few years, you will let me go, won’t you?’ ‘Top-off!
Half-done!’ answered the mouse, ‘they are such odd names, they make me
very thoughtful.’ ‘You sit at home,’ said the cat, ‘in your dark-grey
fur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that’s because
you do not go out in the daytime.’ During the cat’s absence the mouse
cleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat entirely
emptied the pot of fat. ‘When everything is eaten up one has some
peace,’ said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not return
home till night. The mouse at once asked what name had been given to
the third child. ‘It will not please you more than the others,’ said the
cat. ‘He is called All-gone.’ ‘All-gone,’ cried the mouse ‘that is the
most suspicious name of all! I have never seen it in print. All-gone;
what can that mean?’ and she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay
down to sleep.

From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but
when the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found
outside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: ‘Come, cat,
we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves--we
shall enjoy that.’ ‘Yes,’ answered the cat, ‘you will enjoy it as much
as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the
window.’ They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of
fat certainly was still in its place, but it was empty. ‘Alas!’ said the
mouse, ‘now I see what has happened, now it comes to light! You are a true
friend! You have devoured all when you were standing godmother. First
top off, then half-done, then--’ ‘Will you hold your tongue,’ cried the
cat, ‘one word more, and I will eat you too.’ ‘All-gone’ was already on
the poor mouse’s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang
on her, seized her, and swallowed her down. Verily, that is the way of
the world.

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish
of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and
that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw.
When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her
observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards
a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw
began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?’ The coal
replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped
by sheer force, my death would have been certain,--I should have been
burnt to ashes.’ The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin,
but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made
into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.’ ‘And would a better
fate have fallen to my lot?’ said the straw. ‘The old woman has
destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at
once, and took their lives. I luckily slipped through her fingers.’

‘But what are we to do now?’ said the coal.

‘I think,’ answered the bean, ‘that as we have so fortunately escaped
death, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new
mischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and
repair to a foreign country.’

The proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way
together. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was
no bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over
it. The straw hit on a good idea, and said: ‘I will lay myself straight
across, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.’ The straw
therefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal,
who was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the
newly-built bridge. But when she had reached the middle, and heard the
water rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still,
and ventured no farther. The straw, however, began to burn, broke in
two pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed
when she got into the water, and breathed her last. The bean, who had
prudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event,
was unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst. It would
have been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who
was travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook.
As he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread,
and sewed her together. The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the
tailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam.

Now, tell a single original traditional German folktale based on the structure and style above. Do not generate multiple stories. Only one  story should be created, and it should follow the same narrative structure as the examples above. Conclude the story with 'The End.'

","There was once an old woman who lived in a small village. She had a large
garden where she grew many vegetables, and one day she decided to make a
stew with some of the carrots she had grown. So, she lit a fire in her
hearth, and when it was burning well, she began to peel the carrots and
chop them up. As she was working, one carrot slipped out of her hand and
rolled onto the floor. It landed near a piece of charcoal that had fallen
out of the fire, and soon the carrot and the charcoal began to talk.

""Where did you come from?"" asked the carrot.

""I fell out of the fire,"" replied the charcoal. ""If I had not escaped by
some miracle, I would have been burned to ashes.""

""I too have escaped with my life,"" said the carrot. ""If the old woman had
noticed me, she would have thrown me into the stew pot, and I would have
been cooked to death.""

""But what are we to do now?"" asked the charcoal.

""I think we should stick together and travel to a foreign land,"" said the
carrot. ""That way, we can avoid any more mishaps.""

The charcoal and the carrot agreed, and they set off on their journey
together. They walked for many days, and eventually came to a river.
There was no bridge or boat, so they did not know how to cross. The
charcoal suggested that it should lay itself across the river, and the
carrot could walk over it. The charcoal stretched itself out, and the
carrot began to cross. But as soon as it reached the middle of the river,
it began to burn, and broke into two pieces, falling into the water. The
carrot slipped after it, and was immediately extinguished.

A traveling merchant happened to be passing by, and saw the two
objects floating in the river. He fished them out, and sewed the carrot
back together with black thread. The carrot thanked the merchant, but
from that day on, all carrots have a black seam.

The End."

A great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was very
beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of the
princes who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her, and she
only made sport of them.

Once upon a time the king held a great feast, and asked thither all
her suitors; and they all sat in a row, ranged according to their
rank--kings, and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons,
and knights. Then the princess came in, and as she passed by them she
had something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat: ‘He’s
as round as a tub,’ said she. The next was too tall: ‘What a maypole!’
said she. The next was too short: ‘What a dumpling!’ said she. The
fourth was too pale, and she called him ‘Wallface.’ The fifth was too
red, so she called him ‘Coxcomb.’ The sixth was not straight enough;
so she said he was like a green stick, that had been laid to dry over
a baker’s oven. And thus she had some joke to crack upon every one: but
she laughed more than all at a good king who was there. ‘Look at
him,’ said she; ‘his beard is like an old mop; he shall be called
Grisly-beard.’ So the king got the nickname of Grisly-beard.

But the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved,
and how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or
unwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that
came to the door.

Two days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play
under the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said,
‘Let him come in.’ So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when
he had sung before the king and the princess, he begged a boon. Then the
king said, ‘You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for
your wife.’ The princess begged and prayed; but the king said, ‘I have
sworn to give you to the first comer, and I will keep my word.’ So words
and tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married
to the fiddler. When this was over the king said, ‘Now get ready to
go--you must not stay here--you must travel on with your husband.’

Then the fiddler went his way, and took her with him, and they soon came
to a great wood. ‘Pray,’ said she, ‘whose is this wood?’ ‘It belongs
to King Grisly-beard,’ answered he; ‘hadst thou taken him, all had been
thine.’ ‘Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘would that I had
married King Grisly-beard!’ Next they came to some fine meadows. ‘Whose
are these beautiful green meadows?’ said she. ‘They belong to King
Grisly-beard, hadst thou taken him, they had all been thine.’ ‘Ah!
unlucky wretch that I am!’ said she; ‘would that I had married King
Grisly-beard!’

Then they came to a great city. ‘Whose is this noble city?’ said she.
‘It belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all been
thine.’ ‘Ah! wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘why did I not marry King
Grisly-beard?’ ‘That is no business of mine,’ said the fiddler: ‘why
should you wish for another husband? Am not I good enough for you?’

At last they came to a small cottage. ‘What a paltry place!’ said she;
‘to whom does that little dirty hole belong?’ Then the fiddler said,
‘That is your and my house, where we are to live.’ ‘Where are your
servants?’ cried she. ‘What do we want with servants?’ said he; ‘you
must do for yourself whatever is to be done. Now make the fire, and put
on water and cook my supper, for I am very tired.’ But the princess knew
nothing of making fires and cooking, and the fiddler was forced to help
her. When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the
fiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house. Thus
they lived for two days: and when they had eaten up all there was in the
cottage, the man said, ‘Wife, we can’t go on thus, spending money and
earning nothing. You must learn to weave baskets.’ Then he went out and
cut willows, and brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made
her fingers very sore. ‘I see this work won’t do,’ said he: ‘try and
spin; perhaps you will do that better.’ So she sat down and tried to
spin; but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran. ‘See
now,’ said the fiddler, ‘you are good for nothing; you can do no work:
what a bargain I have got! However, I’ll try and set up a trade in pots
and pans, and you shall stand in the market and sell them.’ ‘Alas!’
sighed she, ‘if any of my father’s court should pass by and see me
standing in the market, how they will laugh at me!’

But her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if she
did not wish to die of hunger. At first the trade went well; for many
people, seeing such a beautiful woman, went to buy her wares, and paid
their money without thinking of taking away the goods. They lived on
this as long as it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of
ware, and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market; but
a drunken soldier soon came by, and rode his horse against her stall,
and broke all her goods into a thousand pieces. Then she began to cry,
and knew not what to do. ‘Ah! what will become of me?’ said she; ‘what
will my husband say?’ So she ran home and told him all. ‘Who would
have thought you would have been so silly,’ said he, ‘as to put an
earthenware stall in the corner of the market, where everybody passes?
but let us have no more crying; I see you are not fit for this sort of
work, so I have been to the king’s palace, and asked if they did not
want a kitchen-maid; and they say they will take you, and there you will
have plenty to eat.’

Thus the princess became a kitchen-maid, and helped the cook to do all
the dirtiest work; but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat
that was left, and on this they lived.

She had not been there long before she heard that the king’s eldest son
was passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the windows
and looked out. Everything was ready, and all the pomp and brightness of
the court was there. Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly
which had brought her so low. And the servants gave her some of the rich
meats, which she put into her basket to take home.

All on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king’s son in golden
clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her
by the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she
trembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was
making sport of her. However, he kept fast hold, and led her in; and the
cover of the basket came off, so that the meats in it fell about. Then
everybody laughed and jeered at her; and she was so abashed, that she
wished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth. She sprang to the
door to run away; but on the steps King Grisly-beard overtook her, and
brought her back and said, ‘Fear me not! I am the fiddler who has lived
with you in the hut. I brought you there because I really loved you. I
am also the soldier that overset your stall. I have done all this only
to cure you of your silly pride, and to show you the folly of your
ill-treatment of me. Now all is over: you have learnt wisdom, and it is
time to hold our marriage feast.’

Then the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes; and
her father and his whole court were there already, and welcomed her home
on her marriage. Joy was in every face and every heart. The feast was
grand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish that you
and I had been of the party.

Two kings’ sons once upon a time went into the world to seek their
fortunes; but they soon fell into a wasteful foolish way of living, so
that they could not return home again. Then their brother, who was a
little insignificant dwarf, went out to seek for his brothers: but when
he had found them they only laughed at him, to think that he, who was so
young and simple, should try to travel through the world, when they, who
were so much wiser, had been unable to get on. However, they all set
out on their journey together, and came at last to an ant-hill. The two
elder brothers would have pulled it down, in order to see how the poor
ants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs. But the
little dwarf said, ‘Let the poor things enjoy themselves, I will not
suffer you to trouble them.’

So on they went, and came to a lake where many many ducks were swimming
about. The two brothers wanted to catch two, and roast them. But the
dwarf said, ‘Let the poor things enjoy themselves, you shall not kill
them.’ Next they came to a bees’-nest in a hollow tree, and there was
so much honey that it ran down the trunk; and the two brothers wanted to
light a fire under the tree and kill the bees, so as to get their honey.
But the dwarf held them back, and said, ‘Let the pretty insects enjoy
themselves, I cannot let you burn them.’

At length the three brothers came to a castle: and as they passed by the
stables they saw fine horses standing there, but all were of marble, and
no man was to be seen. Then they went through all the rooms, till they
came to a door on which were three locks: but in the middle of the door
was a wicket, so that they could look into the next room. There they saw
a little grey old man sitting at a table; and they called to him once or
twice, but he did not hear: however, they called a third time, and then
he rose and came out to them.

He said nothing, but took hold of them and led them to a beautiful
table covered with all sorts of good things: and when they had eaten and
drunk, he showed each of them to a bed-chamber.

The next morning he came to the eldest and took him to a marble table,
where there were three tablets, containing an account of the means by
which the castle might be disenchanted. The first tablet said: ‘In the
wood, under the moss, lie the thousand pearls belonging to the king’s
daughter; they must all be found: and if one be missing by set of sun,
he who seeks them will be turned into marble.’

The eldest brother set out, and sought for the pearls the whole day:
but the evening came, and he had not found the first hundred: so he was
turned into stone as the tablet had foretold.

The next day the second brother undertook the task; but he succeeded no
better than the first; for he could only find the second hundred of the
pearls; and therefore he too was turned into stone.

At last came the little dwarf’s turn; and he looked in the moss; but it
was so hard to find the pearls, and the job was so tiresome!--so he sat
down upon a stone and cried. And as he sat there, the king of the ants
(whose life he had saved) came to help him, with five thousand ants; and
it was not long before they had found all the pearls and laid them in a
heap.

The second tablet said: ‘The key of the princess’s bed-chamber must be
fished up out of the lake.’ And as the dwarf came to the brink of it,
he saw the two ducks whose lives he had saved swimming about; and they
dived down and soon brought in the key from the bottom.

The third task was the hardest. It was to choose out the youngest and
the best of the king’s three daughters. Now they were all beautiful, and
all exactly alike: but he was told that the eldest had eaten a piece of
sugar, the next some sweet syrup, and the youngest a spoonful of honey;
so he was to guess which it was that had eaten the honey.

Then came the queen of the bees, who had been saved by the little dwarf
from the fire, and she tried the lips of all three; but at last she sat
upon the lips of the one that had eaten the honey: and so the dwarf knew
which was the youngest. Thus the spell was broken, and all who had been
turned into stones awoke, and took their proper forms. And the dwarf
married the youngest and the best of the princesses, and was king after

","In a small village, there lived a poor shoemaker who had a daughter named
Maria. She was the most beautiful girl in the land, but her heart was
cold and cruel, and she turned her nose up at every suitor who came
calling.

One day, the king himself came to ask for her hand in marriage, but Maria
laughed at him and called him a ""fat old man."" The king, who was a kind
and patient soul, left without a word, but he vowed that Maria would
marry the first man who came to the door, no matter who he was.

The very next day, a wandering musician came to the village, playing his
flute and singing his songs. The shoemaker welcomed him in, and he
performed for the king and Maria. When he asked for a reward, the king
offered him his daughter's hand in marriage. Maria begged and pleaded,
but the king would not change his mind.

The musician took Maria away, and they traveled through the forest,
passing by the king's lands. ""Who owns this forest?"" Maria asked. ""It
belongs to the king,"" the musician replied. ""Ah, if only I had married
him,"" Maria sighed.

They came to a beautiful meadow, and Maria asked who it belonged to. ""It
belongs to the king,"" the musician said. ""Ah, if only I had married him,""
Maria sighed.

They came to a grand city, and Maria asked who it belonged to. ""It
belongs to the king,"" the musician said. ""Ah, if only I had married him,""
Maria sighed.

Finally, they came to a small cottage. ""Who does this belong to?"" Maria
asked. ""It belongs to us,"" the musician said. ""Where are your servants?""
Maria asked. ""We don't need any,"" the musician replied. ""You must do
whatever needs to be done.""

Maria was horrified. She had never done a day's work in her life, and she
didn't know the first thing about cooking or cleaning. The musician was
forced to help her, and they lived on the bare minimum.

After a few days, the musician went out to find work. He came back with a
loaf of bread and a jug of wine, and said, ""I have found work as a
baker. You will have to make the bread and sell it in the market.""

Maria was terrified. She had never made bread before, and she was afraid
of the other villagers. But the musician was insistent, and Maria had no
choice but to try.

She went to the market the next day, and set up her stall. But as she was
selling her bread, a group of rowdy soldiers came by, and knocked her
stall over, breaking all her bread and wine. Maria was humiliated, and
ran home in tears.

The musician was angry, and said, ""You are good for nothing. I will take
you back to the king, and you can be a servant in his palace.""

Maria was devastated. She had ruined her father's shoemaking business,
and now she would have to serve the king as a servant. But as they were
walking back to the palace, they came across the king's son, who was
getting ready to go to war.

The king's son saw Maria, and was immediately smitten with her beauty. He
asked her to dance with him, but Maria was too afraid to say yes. The
king's son persisted, and finally Maria agreed.

As they danced, Maria dropped a piece of bread on the floor. The king's
son picked it up and ate it, and Maria was filled with shame. She ran
out of the palace, and the king's son followed her.

""I am the musician who took you away from your father's house,"" he said.
""I did it to teach you a lesson. You were too proud and cruel, and you
deserved to be humbled. But now I see that you have learned your lesson,
and I want to marry you.""

Maria was overjoyed. She had learned her lesson, and she was grateful to
the musician for teaching her. She married the king's son, and they lived
happily ever after.

Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his
two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had
little to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the
land, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought
over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he
groaned and said to his wife: ‘What is to become of us? How are we
to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for
ourselves?’ ‘I’ll tell you what, husband,’ answered the woman, ‘early
tomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where
it is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them, and give each
of them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and
leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be
rid of them.’ ‘No, wife,’ said the man, ‘I will not do that; how can I
bear to leave my children alone in the forest?--the wild animals would
soon come and tear them to pieces.’ ‘O, you fool!’ said she, ‘then we
must all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our
coffins,’ and she left him no peace until he consented. ‘But I feel very
sorry for the poor children, all the same,’ said the man.

The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had
heard what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept
bitter tears, and said to Hansel: ‘Now all is over with us.’ ‘Be quiet,
Gretel,’ said Hansel, ‘do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way
to help us.’ And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put
on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon
shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house
glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the
little pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he went
back and said to Gretel: ‘Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in
peace, God will not forsake us,’ and he lay down again in his bed. When
day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the
two children, saying: ‘Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the
forest to fetch wood.’ She gave each a little piece of bread, and said:
‘There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then,
for you will get nothing else.’ Gretel took the bread under her apron,
as Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out together
on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel
stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again.
His father said: ‘Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying
behind for? Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs.’ ‘Ah,
father,’ said Hansel, ‘I am looking at my little white cat, which is
sitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me.’ The wife said:
‘Fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is
shining on the chimneys.’ Hansel, however, had not been looking back at
the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones
out of his pocket on the road.

When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: ‘Now,
children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not
be cold.’ Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a
little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning
very high, the woman said: ‘Now, children, lay yourselves down by the
fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we
have done, we will come back and fetch you away.’

Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little
piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they
believed that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but
a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was
blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long
time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When
at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and
said: ‘How are we to get out of the forest now?’ But Hansel comforted
her and said: ‘Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we
will soon find the way.’ And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took
his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like
newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.

They walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more
to their father’s house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman
opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: ‘You naughty
children, why have you slept so long in the forest?--we thought you were
never coming back at all!’ The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut
him to the heart to leave them behind alone.

Not long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the
land, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their
father: ‘Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that
is the end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the
wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other
means of saving ourselves!’ The man’s heart was heavy, and he thought:
‘It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your
children.’ The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to
say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise,
and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time
also.

The children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation.
When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go
out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked
the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his
little sister, and said: ‘Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the
good God will help us.’

Early in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their
beds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller
than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his
in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground.
‘Hansel, why do you stop and look round?’ said the father, ‘go on.’ ‘I
am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and
wants to say goodbye to me,’ answered Hansel. ‘Fool!’ said the woman,
‘that is not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining
on the chimney.’ Hansel, however little by little, threw all the crumbs
on the path.

The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had
never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and
the mother said: ‘Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired
you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in
the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.’ When
it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had
scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but
no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark
night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said: ‘Just wait,
Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread
which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.’ When
the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many
thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked
them all up. Hansel said to Gretel: ‘We shall soon find the way,’ but
they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day
too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest,
and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three
berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their
legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell
asleep.

It was now three mornings since they had left their father’s house. They
began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if
help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it
was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough,
which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And
when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them,
and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of
which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw
that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows
were of clear sugar. ‘We will set to work on that,’ said Hansel, ‘and
have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat
some of the window, it will taste sweet.’ Hansel reached up above, and
broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant
against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried
from the parlour:

 ‘Nibble, nibble, gnaw,
  Who is nibbling at my little house?’

The children answered:

 ‘The wind, the wind,
  The heaven-born wind,’

and went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the
taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out
the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with
it. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who
supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were
so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their
hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said: ‘Oh, you dear
children, who has brought you here? do come in, and stay with me. No
harm shall happen to you.’ She took them both by the hand, and led them
into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and
pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little
beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down
in them, and thought they were in heaven.

The old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality
a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the
little house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell
into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast
day with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have
a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near.
When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighbourhood, she laughed with
malice, and said mockingly: ‘I have them, they shall not escape me
again!’ Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was
already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so
pretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself: ‘That
will be a dainty mouthful!’ Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled
hand, carried him into a little stable, and locked him in behind a
grated door. Scream as he might, it would not help him. Then she went to
Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: ‘Get up, lazy thing, fetch
some water, and cook something good for your brother, he is in the
stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.’
Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for she was
forced to do what the wicked witch commanded.

And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing
but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and
cried: ‘Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon
be fat.’ Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and
the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was
Hansel’s finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening
him. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she
was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. ‘Now, then,
Gretel,’ she cried to the girl, ‘stir yourself, and bring some water.
Let Hansel be fat or lean, tomorrow I will kill him, and cook him.’ Ah,
how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water,
and how her tears did flow down her cheeks! ‘Dear God, do help us,’ she
cried. ‘If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should
at any rate have died together.’ ‘Just keep your noise to yourself,’
said the old woman, ‘it won’t help you at all.’

Early in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with
the water, and light the fire. ‘We will bake first,’ said the old woman,
‘I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.’ She pushed poor
Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting.
‘Creep in,’ said the witch, ‘and see if it is properly heated, so that
we can put the bread in.’ And once Gretel was inside, she intended to
shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too.
But Gretel saw what she had in mind, and said: ‘I do not know how I am
to do it; how do I get in?’ ‘Silly goose,’ said the old woman. ‘The door
is big enough; just look, I can get in myself!’ and she crept up and
thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove
her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then
she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away and the godless
witch was miserably burnt to death.

Gretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable,
and cried: ‘Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!’ Then Hansel
sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened. How they did
rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And
as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch’s
house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels.
‘These are far better than pebbles!’ said Hansel, and thrust into his
pockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said: ‘I, too, will take
something home with me,’ and filled her pinafore full. ‘But now we must
be off,’ said Hansel, ‘that we may get out of the witch’s forest.’

When they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of
water. ‘We cannot cross,’ said Hansel, ‘I see no foot-plank, and no
bridge.’ ‘And there is also no ferry,’ answered Gretel, ‘but a white
duck is swimming there: if I ask her, she will help us over.’ Then she
cried:

 ‘Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,
  Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?
  There’s never a plank, or bridge in sight,
  Take us across on thy back so white.’

The duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told
his sister to sit by him. ‘No,’ replied Gretel, ‘that will be too heavy
for the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.’ The
good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had
walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar
to them, and at length they saw from afar their father’s house. Then
they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round
their father’s neck. The man had not known one happy hour since he had
left the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel
emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the
room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to
add to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together
in perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse; whosoever
catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.

","Deep in the heart of the Black Forest, a poor woodcutter named Heinrich lived with his wife and their two children, a boy named Karl and a girl named Greta. The family was struggling to make ends meet, and one night, as they lay in bed, the wife whispered to Heinrich, ""We must do something about our children. We have nothing left to feed them, and they are growing weaker every day. Let us take them deep into the forest tomorrow, and leave them there to die.""

Heinrich was horrified at the thought, but his wife was insistent. ""We have no other choice,"" she said. ""If we do not do this, we will all starve to death.""

The next morning, Heinrich and his wife took Karl and Greta into the forest, giving them each a piece of bread and a small flask of water. ""This is all you will get,"" the wife said cruelly. ""We will come back for you in a few days, but do not expect us to find you.""

As they walked deeper into the forest, Greta could not help but cry. Karl tried to comfort her, but his own heart was heavy with fear. As they walked, Heinrich stopped and looked back at their home, and Greta followed his gaze. ""I see our cat,"" she said. ""She is watching us and saying goodbye.""

""No, my child,"" Heinrich said gently. ""That is not our cat. That is the morning sun shining on the trees.""

As they walked further, they came to a clearing where a large fire had been built. ""Sit here and rest,"" Heinrich said. ""We will go into the forest to cut wood, and when we return, we will take you home.""

Greta and Karl sat by the fire, and as the day wore on, they grew more and more hungry. They shared their bread between them, saving a little for later. As night fell, they huddled together for warmth, and soon they were fast asleep.

When they awoke the next morning, Heinrich and his wife were nowhere to be found. Greta began to cry, but Karl tried to comfort her. ""Do not worry, Greta,"" he said. ""We will find a way out of this forest.""

They set off into the woods, following the path that their parents had taken. As they walked, Karl began to feel a strange sense of familiarity. ""I think we have been here before,"" he said.

Greta looked around, but she could not see anything that looked familiar. ""I do not know where we are,"" she said. ""I am afraid we will never find our way out of this forest.""

As they walked, they came upon a small house, built entirely of gingerbread and candy. ""Look, Greta,"" Karl said. ""This must be where the witch lives.""

Greta was frightened, but she could not take her eyes off the house. They crept closer, and as they did, the door opened and an old woman stepped out. She was hideous to look at, with long, sharp nails and a wart on her nose that was as big as a hen's egg.

""Come in, my children,"" she said. ""I have been expecting you. You will stay here with me, and I will take good care of you.""

Greta and Karl exchanged a frightened glance, but they had no choice. They followed the witch into the house, and she led them to a small room where they were given a bed to sleep in.

The next morning, the witch woke them up early and gave them a bowl of porridge to eat. It was the most delicious porridge they had ever tasted, but they knew that it was not good for them. They finished their porridge as quickly as they could, and then the witch took them out into the forest to gather firewood.

As they worked, Greta noticed that the witch was constantly looking around, as if she were expecting someone. ""Who is it that you are waiting for?"" she asked.

The witch laughed cruelly. ""I am waiting for my next meal,"" she said. ""I have been waiting a long time for a nice, fat child to come along.""

Greta and Karl shuddered at the thought, but they continued to work, gathering as much firewood as they could. When they had finished, the witch led them back to the house, and they went inside to rest.

The next day, the witch took them out into the forest again, and this time she gave them a bag and told them to gather as many berries as they could find. Greta and Karl worked hard, but they could not find very many berries. When they returned to the house, the witch was furious. ""You have not gathered enough berries!"" she screamed. ""I will have to find another way to feed myself!""

Greta and Karl cowered before her, terrified. They knew that they were in grave danger. That night, as they lay in bed, Greta whispered to Karl. ""I have an idea,"" she said. ""We must wait until the witch is asleep, and then we must escape.""

Karl nodded, and they lay awake, listening for the sound of the witch's snoring. When they heard it, they crept out of their bed and tiptoed out of the house. They made their way back to the clearing where the fire had been built, and they followed the path that their parents had taken.

They walked for hours, but they could not find their way out of the forest. Greta began to cry, but Karl tried to comfort her. ""Do not worry, Greta,"" he said. ""We will find our way out, I promise.""

Just as they were beginning to lose hope, they came upon a small stream. ""I think this is the way out,"" Karl said. ""We must follow the stream, and we will surely find our way home.""

They followed the stream, and as they walked, they began to see familiar landmarks. They passed by the old mill, and then they saw the church spire in the distance. They ran as fast as they could, and soon they were standing in front of their own house.

Heinrich and his wife were shocked to see them, and they rushed out to greet them. ""We have been looking for you everywhere!"" Heinrich said. ""We thought we had lost you forever!""

Greta and Karl threw themselves into their father's arms, and they were never again separated from their family. The witch was never seen again, and the family lived happily ever after.

There was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and had two
daughters, one ugly and wicked, and this one she loved because she was
her own daughter, and one beautiful and good, and this one she hated,
because she was her stepdaughter. The stepdaughter once had a pretty
apron, which the other fancied so much that she became envious, and
told her mother that she must and would have that apron. ‘Be quiet, my
child,’ said the old woman, ‘and you shall have it. Your stepsister has
long deserved death; tonight when she is asleep I will come and cut her
head off. Only be careful that you are at the far side of the bed, and
push her well to the front.’ It would have been all over with the poor
girl if she had not just then been standing in a corner, and heard
everything. All day long she dared not go out of doors, and when bedtime
had come, the witch’s daughter got into bed first, so as to lie at the
far side, but when she was asleep, the other pushed her gently to the
front, and took for herself the place at the back, close by the wall. In
the night, the old woman came creeping in, she held an axe in her right
hand, and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the outside,
and then she grasped the axe with both hands, and cut her own child’s
head off.

When she had gone away, the girl got up and went to her sweetheart, who
was called Roland, and knocked at his door. When he came out, she said
to him: ‘Listen, dearest Roland, we must fly in all haste; my stepmother
wanted to kill me, but has struck her own child. When daylight comes,
and she sees what she has done, we shall be lost.’ ‘But,’ said Roland,
‘I counsel you first to take away her magic wand, or we cannot escape
if she pursues us.’ The maiden fetched the magic wand, and she took the
dead girl’s head and dropped three drops of blood on the ground, one in
front of the bed, one in the kitchen, and one on the stairs. Then she
hurried away with her lover.

When the old witch got up next morning, she called her daughter, and
wanted to give her the apron, but she did not come. Then the witch
cried: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Here, on the stairs, I am sweeping,’ answered
the first drop of blood. The old woman went out, but saw no one on the
stairs, and cried again: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Here in the kitchen, I am
warming myself,’ cried the second drop of blood. She went into the
kitchen, but found no one. Then she cried again: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Ah,
here in the bed, I am sleeping,’ cried the third drop of blood. She went
into the room to the bed. What did she see there? Her own child,
whose head she had cut off, bathed in her blood. The witch fell into
a passion, sprang to the window, and as she could look forth quite far
into the world, she perceived her stepdaughter hurrying away with her
sweetheart Roland. ‘That shall not help you,’ cried she, ‘even if you
have got a long way off, you shall still not escape me.’ She put on her
many-league boots, in which she covered an hour’s walk at every step,
and it was not long before she overtook them. The girl, however, when
she saw the old woman striding towards her, changed, with her magic
wand, her sweetheart Roland into a lake, and herself into a duck
swimming in the middle of it. The witch placed herself on the shore,
threw breadcrumbs in, and went to endless trouble to entice the duck;
but the duck did not let herself be enticed, and the old woman had to
go home at night as she had come. At this the girl and her sweetheart
Roland resumed their natural shapes again, and they walked on the whole
night until daybreak. Then the maiden changed herself into a beautiful
flower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge, and her sweetheart
Roland into a fiddler. It was not long before the witch came striding up
towards them, and said to the musician: ‘Dear musician, may I pluck that
beautiful flower for myself?’ ‘Oh, yes,’ he replied, ‘I will play to
you while you do it.’ As she was hastily creeping into the hedge and was
just going to pluck the flower, knowing perfectly well who the flower
was, he began to play, and whether she would or not, she was forced
to dance, for it was a magical dance. The faster he played, the more
violent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes
from her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he
did not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground.

As they were now set free, Roland said: ‘Now I will go to my father and
arrange for the wedding.’ ‘Then in the meantime I will stay here and
wait for you,’ said the girl, ‘and that no one may recognize me, I will
change myself into a red stone landmark.’ Then Roland went away, and the
girl stood like a red landmark in the field and waited for her beloved.
But when Roland got home, he fell into the snares of another, who so
fascinated him that he forgot the maiden. The poor girl remained there a
long time, but at length, as he did not return at all, she was sad, and
changed herself into a flower, and thought: ‘Someone will surely come
this way, and trample me down.’

It befell, however, that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field and saw
the flower, and as it was so pretty, plucked it, took it with him, and
laid it away in his chest. From that time forth, strange things happened
in the shepherd’s house. When he arose in the morning, all the work was
already done, the room was swept, the table and benches cleaned, the
fire in the hearth was lighted, and the water was fetched, and at noon,
when he came home, the table was laid, and a good dinner served. He
could not conceive how this came to pass, for he never saw a human being
in his house, and no one could have concealed himself in it. He was
certainly pleased with this good attendance, but still at last he was so
afraid that he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice. The wise
woman said: ‘There is some enchantment behind it, listen very early some
morning if anything is moving in the room, and if you see anything, no
matter what it is, throw a white cloth over it, and then the magic will
be stopped.’

The shepherd did as she bade him, and next morning just as day dawned,
he saw the chest open, and the flower come out. Swiftly he
sprang towards it, and threw a white cloth over it. Instantly the
transformation came to an end, and a beautiful girl stood before him,
who admitted to him that she had been the flower, and that up to this
time she had attended to his house-keeping. She told him her story,
and as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him, but she
answered: ‘No,’ for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart
Roland, although he had deserted her. Nevertheless, she promised not to
go away, but to continue keeping house for the shepherd.

And now the time drew near when Roland’s wedding was to be celebrated,
and then, according to an old custom in the country, it was announced
that all the girls were to be present at it, and sing in honour of the
bridal pair. When the faithful maiden heard of this, she grew so sad
that she thought her heart would break, and she would not go thither,
but the other girls came and took her. When it came to her turn to sing,
she stepped back, until at last she was the only one left, and then she
could not refuse. But when she began her song, and it reached Roland’s
ears, he sprang up and cried: ‘I know the voice, that is the true
bride, I will have no other!’ Everything he had forgotten, and which had
vanished from his mind, had suddenly come home again to his heart. Then
the faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart Roland, and
grief came to an end and joy began.
A shepherd’s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him
suffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he
took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood.
On the road he met a sparrow that said to him, ‘Why are you so sad,
my friend?’ ‘Because,’ said the dog, ‘I am very very hungry, and have
nothing to eat.’ ‘If that be all,’ answered the sparrow, ‘come with me
into the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.’ So on they
went together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher’s shop,
the sparrow said to the dog, ‘Stand there a little while till I peck you
down a piece of meat.’ So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having
first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she
pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf,
till at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up, and scrambled
away with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up. ‘Well,’ said
the sparrow, ‘you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to
the next shop, and I will peck you down another steak.’ When the dog had
eaten this too, the sparrow said to him, ‘Well, my good friend, have you
had enough now?’ ‘I have had plenty of meat,’ answered he, ‘but I should
like to have a piece of bread to eat after it.’ ‘Come with me then,’
said the sparrow, ‘and you shall soon have that too.’ So she took him
to a baker’s shop, and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window, till
they fell down: and as the dog still wished for more, she took him to
another shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten, the
sparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. ‘Yes,’ said he; ‘and
now let us take a walk a little way out of the town.’ So they both went
out upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone
far before the dog said, ‘I am very much tired--I should like to take a
nap.’ ‘Very well,’ answered the sparrow, ‘do so, and in the meantime
I will perch upon that bush.’ So the dog stretched himself out on the
road, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with
a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. The
sparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would
go on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called
out, ‘Stop! stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.’ But the
carter, grumbling to himself, ‘You make it the worse for me, indeed!
what can you do?’ cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor
dog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. ‘There,’ cried the
sparrow, ‘thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now
mind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.’
‘Do your worst, and welcome,’ said the brute, ‘what harm can you do me?’
and passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and
pecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and then
all the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it. At last he looked
round, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty.
‘What an unlucky wretch I am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said
the sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses, and
pecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the carter saw this,
he drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill
her; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horse’s head
with such force, that he fell down dead. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’
cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the sparrow. And as the carter
went on with the other two horses, she again crept under the tilt of the
cart, and pecked out the bung of the second cask, so that all the wine
ran out. When the carter saw this, he again cried out, ‘Miserable wretch
that I am!’ But the sparrow answered, ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ and
perched on the head of the second horse, and pecked at him too. The
carter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she
flew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the
spot. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ said he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said
the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him
too. The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or
caring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his
third horse as he done the other two. ‘Alas! miserable wretch that I
am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ answered the sparrow as she flew
away; ‘now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.’ The
carter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home
overflowing with rage and vexation. ‘Alas!’ said he to his wife, ‘what
ill luck has befallen me!--my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three
dead.’ ‘Alas! husband,’ replied she, ‘and a wicked bird has come into
the house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am
sure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it
up at such a rate!’ Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of
birds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the
midst of them. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ cried the carter; for he saw
that the corn was almost all gone. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the
sparrow; ‘thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life yet!’ and away she flew.

The carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down
into his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat
himself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow sat
on the outside of the window, and cried ‘Carter! thy cruelty shall cost
thee thy life!’ With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet,
and threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the
window. The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window-seat, and
cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!’ Then he became mad and
blind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he
cleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter
and his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture,
glasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without
touching the bird at all. In the end, however, they caught her: and the
wife said, ‘Shall I kill her at once?’ ‘No,’ cried he, ‘that is letting
her off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat
her.’ But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck
and cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!’ With that he
could wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, ‘Wife,
strike at the bird and kill her in my hand.’ And the wife struck; but
she missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down
dead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.

","Once upon a time, there was a man who was a real sorcerer and had two sons, one ugly and wicked, and this one he loved because he was his own son, and one beautiful and good, and this one he hated, because he was his stepson. The stepson once had a precious gem, which the other son fancied so much that he became envious, and told his father that he must and would have that gem. ‘Be quiet, my child,’ said the old sorcerer, ‘and you shall have it. Your stepbrother has long deserved death; tonight when he is asleep I will come and steal his heart. Only be careful that you are at the far side of the bed, and push him well to the front.’ It would have been all over with the poor boy if he had not just then been standing in a corner, and heard everything. All day long he dared not go out of doors, and when bedtime had come, the sorcerer's son got into bed first, so as to lie at the far side, but when he was asleep, the other pushed him gently to the front, and took for himself the place at the back, close by the wall. In the night, the old sorcerer came creeping in, he held a knife in his right hand, and felt with his left to see if anyone were lying at the outside, and then he grasped the knife with both hands, and cut his own son's heart out.

When he had gone away, the stepson got up and went to his sweetheart, who was called Agnes, and knocked at her door. When she came out, he said to her: ‘Listen, dearest Agnes, we must fly in all haste; my father wanted to kill me, but has stolen my heart. Only be careful that you are at the far side of the bed, and push me well to the front.’ It would have been all over with the poor boy if he had not just then been standing in a corner, and heard everything.

A farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to
him: but he was now grown too old to work; so the farmer would give him
nothing more to eat, and said, ‘I want you no longer, so take yourself
off out of my stable; I shall not take you back again until you are
stronger than a lion.’ Then he opened the door and turned him adrift.

The poor horse was very melancholy, and wandered up and down in the
wood, seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain. Presently
a fox met him: ‘What’s the matter, my friend?’ said he, ‘why do you hang
down your head and look so lonely and woe-begone?’ ‘Ah!’ replied the
horse, ‘justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has
forgotten all that I have done for him so many years, and because I
can no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless I become
stronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can I
have of that? he knows I have none, or he would not talk so.’

However, the fox bid him be of good cheer, and said, ‘I will help you;
lie down there, stretch yourself out quite stiff, and pretend to be
dead.’ The horse did as he was told, and the fox went straight to the
lion who lived in a cave close by, and said to him, ‘A little way off
lies a dead horse; come with me and you may make an excellent meal of
his carcase.’ The lion was greatly pleased, and set off immediately; and
when they came to the horse, the fox said, ‘You will not be able to eat
him comfortably here; I’ll tell you what--I will tie you fast to
his tail, and then you can draw him to your den, and eat him at your
leisure.’

This advice pleased the lion, so he laid himself down quietly for the
fox to make him fast to the horse. But the fox managed to tie his legs
together and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength he
could not set himself free. When the work was done, the fox clapped the
horse on the shoulder, and said, ‘Jip! Dobbin! Jip!’ Then up he sprang,
and moved off, dragging the lion behind him. The beast began to roar
and bellow, till all the birds of the wood flew away for fright; but the
horse let him sing on, and made his way quietly over the fields to his
master’s house.

‘Here he is, master,’ said he, ‘I have got the better of him’: and when
the farmer saw his old servant, his heart relented, and he said. ‘Thou
shalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of.’ And so the poor old
horse had plenty to eat, and lived--till he died.
A shepherd’s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him
suffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he
took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood.
On the road he met a sparrow that said to him, ‘Why are you so sad,

There was once a man who had seven sons, and last of all one daughter.
Although the little girl was very pretty, she was so weak and small that
they thought she could not live; but they said she should at once be
christened.

So the father sent one of his sons in haste to the spring to get some
water, but the other six ran with him. Each wanted to be first at
drawing the water, and so they were in such a hurry that all let their
pitchers fall into the well, and they stood very foolishly looking at
one another, and did not know what to do, for none dared go home. In the
meantime the father was uneasy, and could not tell what made the
young men stay so long. ‘Surely,’ said he, ‘the whole seven must have
forgotten themselves over some game of play’; and when he had waited
still longer and they yet did not come, he flew into a rage and wished
them all turned into ravens. Scarcely had he spoken these words when he
heard a croaking over his head, and looked up and saw seven ravens as
black as coal flying round and round. Sorry as he was to see his wish
so fulfilled, he did not know how what was done could be undone, and
comforted himself as well as he could for the loss of his seven sons
with his dear little daughter, who soon became stronger and every day
more beautiful.

For a long time she did not know that she had ever had any brothers; for
her father and mother took care not to speak of them before her: but one
day by chance she heard the people about her speak of them. ‘Yes,’ said
they, ‘she is beautiful indeed, but still ‘tis a pity that her brothers
should have been lost for her sake.’ Then she was much grieved, and went
to her father and mother, and asked if she had any brothers, and what
had become of them. So they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but
said it was the will of Heaven, and that her birth was only the innocent
cause of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day, and
thought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back;
and she had neither rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole
away, and set out into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever
they might be, and free them, whatever it might cost her.

She took nothing with her but a little ring which her father and mother
had given her, a loaf of bread in case she should be hungry, a little
pitcher of water in case she should be thirsty, and a little stool
to rest upon when she should be weary. Thus she went on and on, and
journeyed till she came to the world’s end; then she came to the sun,
but the sun looked much too hot and fiery; so she ran away quickly to
the moon, but the moon was cold and chilly, and said, ‘I smell flesh
and blood this way!’ so she took herself away in a hurry and came to the
stars, and the stars were friendly and kind to her, and each star sat
upon his own little stool; but the morning star rose up and gave her a
little piece of wood, and said, ‘If you have not this little piece of
wood, you cannot unlock the castle that stands on the glass-mountain,
and there your brothers live.’ The little girl took the piece of wood,
rolled it up in a little cloth, and went on again until she came to the
glass-mountain, and found the door shut. Then she felt for the little
piece of wood; but when she unwrapped the cloth it was not there, and
she saw she had lost the gift of the good stars. What was to be done?
She wanted to save her brothers, and had no key of the castle of the
glass-mountain; so this faithful little sister took a knife out of her
pocket and cut off her little finger, that was just the size of the
piece of wood she had lost, and put it in the door and opened it.

As she went in, a little dwarf came up to her, and said, ‘What are you
seeking for?’ ‘I seek for my brothers, the seven ravens,’ answered she.
Then the dwarf said, ‘My masters are not at home; but if you will wait
till they come, pray step in.’ Now the little dwarf was getting their
dinner ready, and he brought their food upon seven little plates, and
their drink in seven little glasses, and set them upon the table, and
out of each little plate their sister ate a small piece, and out of each
little glass she drank a small drop; but she let the ring that she had
brought with her fall into the last glass.

On a sudden she heard a fluttering and croaking in the air, and the
dwarf said, ‘Here come my masters.’ When they came in, they wanted to
eat and drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses. Then said
one after the other,

‘Who has eaten from my little plate? And who has been drinking out of my
little glass?’

 ‘Caw! Caw! well I ween
  Mortal lips have this way been.’

When the seventh came to the bottom of his glass, and found there the
ring, he looked at it, and knew that it was his father’s and mother’s,
and said, ‘O that our little sister would but come! then we should be
free.’ When the little girl heard this (for she stood behind the door
all the time and listened), she ran forward, and in an instant all
the ravens took their right form again; and all hugged and kissed each

","In a small village lived a cobbler named Hans. He had six sons, but one day, his wife gave birth to a daughter. The girl was beautiful, but weak and small, and the villagers thought she would not survive. Hans, however, insisted on a christening, and his wife agreed.

On the day of the christening, Hans sent his eldest son to fetch water from the well, but the other five boys ran with him, each wanting to be the first to draw the water. In their haste, they all dropped their pitchers into the well, and they stood there, unsure of what to do. Meanwhile, Hans grew worried and thought his sons had forgotten themselves over some game.

""May they all turn into ravens!"" he exclaimed, unaware of the consequences of his words. Scarcely had he spoken when he heard a cawing overhead, and he looked up to see his five sons transform into ravens, black as coal, flying round and round. Hans was sorry for what he had done, but he did not know how to undo it, and he took comfort in his dear little daughter, who soon became stronger and more beautiful.

For a long time, the girl did not know she had any brothers, but one day she overheard the villagers talking about them. ""Yes,"" they said, ""she is beautiful indeed, but it's a pity that her brothers should have been lost for her sake."" The little girl went to her father and asked if she had any brothers, and what had become of them. Her father and mother dared not hide the truth from her, and they told her about her brothers, lost because of her birth.

The little girl mourned for her brothers every day, and she decided to set out into the world to find them and free them, no matter the cost. She took a little ring her father and mother had given her, a loaf of bread, a little pitcher of water, and a little stool to rest upon when she grew weary.

She journeyed for days, until she came to the world's end, and then to the sun, but the sun was too hot, so she went to the moon, but the moon was too cold. She went to the stars, and each star sat upon its own little stool, but the morning star rose up and gave her a little piece of wood, saying, ""If you have not this little piece of wood, you cannot unlock the castle that stands on the glass-mountain, and there your brothers live.""

The little girl took the piece of wood, rolled it up in a little cloth, and continued her journey until she came to the glass-mountain. She found the door shut, and when she felt for the little piece of wood, she realized she had lost it. Desperate to save her brothers, she took a knife out of her pocket and cut off her little finger, which was just the size of the piece of wood she had lost, and used it to open the door.

Inside, she found a little dwarf who asked what she was seeking. ""I seek for my brothers, the seven ravens,"" she answered. The dwarf said her masters were not at home, but if she would wait, she could eat with them when they came. The dwarf brought their food and drink, and the little girl ate and drank a little from each plate and glass, but she let the ring that she had brought with her fall into the last glass.

On a sudden, she heard a fluttering and cawing in the air, and the dwarf said, ""Here come my masters."" When they came in, they wanted to eat and drink, and they looked for their little plates and glasses. One after the other, they asked, ""Who has eaten from my little plate? And who has been drinking out of my little glass?""

""Caw! Caw! well I ween
  Mortal lips have this way been.""

When the seventh came to the bottom of his glass and found the ring, he looked at it and knew that it was his father's and mother's. ""O that our little sister would but come!"" he said, and the little girl ran forward, and in an instant, all the ravens took their right form again, and all hugged and kissed each other, and went merrily home.

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish
of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and
that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw.
When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her
observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards
a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw
began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?’ The coal
replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped
by sheer force, my death would have been certain,--I should have been
burnt to ashes.’ The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin,
but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made
into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.’ ‘And would a better
fate have fallen to my lot?’ said the straw. ‘The old woman has
destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at
once, and took their lives. I luckily slipped through her fingers.’

‘But what are we to do now?’ said the coal.

‘I think,’ answered the bean, ‘that as we have so fortunately escaped
death, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new
mischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and
repair to a foreign country.’

The proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way
together. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was
no bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over
it. The straw hit on a good idea, and said: ‘I will lay myself straight
across, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.’ The straw
therefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal,
who was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the
newly-built bridge. But when she had reached the middle, and heard the
water rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still,
and ventured no farther. The straw, however, began to burn, broke in
two pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed
when she got into the water, and breathed her last. The bean, who had
prudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event,
was unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst. It would
have been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who
was travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook.
As he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread,
and sewed her together. The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the
tailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam.
Two kings’ sons once upon a time went into the world to seek their
fortunes; but they soon fell into a wasteful foolish way of living, so
that they could not return home again. Then their brother, who was a
little insignificant dwarf, went out to seek for his brothers: but when
he had found them they only laughed at him, to think that he, who was so
young and simple, should try to travel through the world, when they, who
were so much wiser, had been unable to get on. However, they all set
out on their journey together, and came at last to an ant-hill. The two
elder brothers would have pulled it down, in order to see how the poor
ants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs. But the
little dwarf said, ‘Let the poor things enjoy themselves, I will not
suffer you to trouble them.’

So on they went, and came to a lake where many many ducks were swimming
about. The two brothers wanted to catch two, and roast them. But the
dwarf said, ‘Let the poor things enjoy themselves, you shall not kill
them.’ Next they came to a bees’-nest in a hollow tree, and there was
so much honey that it ran down the trunk; and the two brothers wanted to
light a fire under the tree and kill the bees, so as to get their honey.
But the dwarf held them back, and said, ‘Let the pretty insects enjoy
themselves, I cannot let you burn them.’

At length the three brothers came to a castle: and as they passed by the
stables they saw fine horses standing there, but all were of marble, and
no man was to be seen. Then they went through all the rooms, till they
came to a door on which were three locks: but in the middle of the door
was a wicket, so that they could look into the next room. There they saw
a little grey old man sitting at a table; and they called to him once or
twice, but he did not hear: however, they called a third time, and then
he rose and came out to them.

He said nothing, but took hold of them and led them to a beautiful
table covered with all sorts of good things: and when they had eaten and
drunk, he showed each of them to a bed-chamber.

The next morning he came to the eldest and took him to a marble table,
where there were three tablets, containing an account of the means by
which the castle might be disenchanted. The first tablet said: ‘In the
wood, under the moss, lie the thousand pearls belonging to the king’s
daughter; they must all be found: and if one be missing by set of sun,
he who seeks them will be turned into marble.’

The eldest brother set out, and sought for the pearls the whole day:
but the evening came, and he had not found the first hundred: so he was
turned into stone as the tablet had foretold.

The next day the second brother undertook the task; but he succeeded no
better than the first; for he could only find the second hundred of the
pearls; and therefore he too was turned into stone.

At last came the little dwarf’s turn; and he looked in the moss; but it
was so hard to find the pearls, and the job was so tiresome!--so he sat
down upon a stone and cried. And as he sat there, the king of the ants
(whose life he had saved) came to help him, with five thousand ants; and
it was not long before they had found all the pearls and laid them in a
heap.

The second tablet said: ‘The key of the princess’s bed-chamber must be
fished up out of the lake.’ And as the dwarf came to the brink of it,
he saw the two ducks whose lives he had saved swimming about; and they
dived down and soon brought in the key from the bottom.

The third task was the hardest. It was to choose out the youngest and
the best of the king’s three daughters. Now they were all beautiful, and
all exactly alike: but he was told that the eldest had eaten a piece of
sugar, the next some sweet syrup, and the youngest a spoonful of honey;
so he was to guess which it was that had eaten the honey.

Then came the queen of the bees, who had been saved by the little dwarf
from the fire, and she tried the lips of all three; but at last she sat
upon the lips of the one that had eaten the honey: and so the dwarf knew
which was the youngest. Thus the spell was broken, and all who had been
turned into stones awoke, and took their proper forms. And the dwarf
married the youngest and the best of the princesses, and was king after
her father’s death; but his two brothers married the other two sisters.
===
A farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard for
him three years, without having been paid any wages. At last it came
into the man’s head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer;
so he went to his master, and said, ‘I have worked hard for you a long
time, I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for my
trouble.’ The farmer was a sad miser, and knew that his man was very
simple-hearted; so he took out threepence, and gave him for every year’s
service a penny. The poor fellow thought it was a great deal of money to
have, and said to himself, ‘Why should I work hard, and live here on bad
fare any longer? I can now travel into the wide world, and make myself
merry.’ With that he put his money into his purse, and set out, roaming
over hill and valley.

As he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little dwarf
met him, and asked him what made him so merry. ‘Why, what should make
me down-hearted?’ said he; ‘I am sound in health and rich in purse, what
should I care for? I have saved up my three years’ earnings and have it
all safe in my pocket.’ ‘How much may it come to?’ said the little man.
‘Full threepence,’ replied the countryman. ‘I wish you would give them
to me,’ said the other; ‘I am very poor.’ Then the man pitied him, and
gave him all he had; and the little dwarf said in return, ‘As you have
such a kind honest heart, I will grant you three wishes--one for every
penny; so choose whatever you like.’ Then the countryman rejoiced at
his good luck, and said, ‘I like many things better than money: first, I
will have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly,
a fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and
thirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask.’ The dwarf
said he should have his three wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle,
and went his way.

Our honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before,
he was now ten times more so. He had not gone far before he met an old
miser: close by them stood a tree, and on the topmost twig sat a thrush
singing away most joyfully. ‘Oh, what a pretty bird!’ said the miser; ‘I
would give a great deal of money to have such a one.’ ‘If that’s all,’
said the countryman, ‘I will soon bring it down.’ Then he took up his
bow, and down fell the thrush into the bushes at the foot of the tree.
The miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into
the middle, his companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the
miser began to dance and spring about, capering higher and higher in
the air. The thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hung
in rags about him, and he himself was all scratched and wounded, so that
the blood ran down. ‘Oh, for heaven’s sake!’ cried the miser, ‘Master!
master! pray let the fiddle alone. What have I done to deserve this?’
‘Thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough,’ said the other; ‘thou
art only meeting thy reward’: so he played up another tune. Then the
miser began to beg and promise, and offered money for his liberty; but
he did not come up to the musician’s price for some time, and he danced
him along brisker and brisker, and the miser bid higher and higher, till
at last he offered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purse,
and had just gained by cheating some poor fellow. When the countryman
saw so much money, he said, ‘I will agree to your proposal.’ So he took
the purse, put up his fiddle, and travelled on very pleased with his
bargain.

Meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous
plight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve
his late companion some trick. At last he went to the judge, and
complained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him
into the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his
back and a fiddle hung round his neck. Then the judge sent out his
officers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him; and he
was soon caught and brought up to be tried.

The miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of
his money. ‘No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you.’ said the
countryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the
matter short by ordering him off to the gallows.

So away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said, ‘My Lord
Judge, grant me one last request.’ ‘Anything but thy life,’ replied the
other. ‘No,’ said he, ‘I do not ask my life; only to let me play upon
my fiddle for the last time.’ The miser cried out, ‘Oh, no! no! for
heaven’s sake don’t listen to him! don’t listen to him!’ But the judge
said, ‘It is only this once, he will soon have done.’ The fact was, he
could not refuse the request, on account of the dwarf’s third gift.

Then the miser said, ‘Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity’s sake.’ But
the countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the first
note judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began capering, and
no one could hold the miser. At the second note the hangman let his
prisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first
bar of the tune, all were dancing together--judge, court, and miser, and
all the people who had followed to look on. At first the thing was merry
and pleasant enough; but when it had gone on a while, and there seemed
to be no end of playing or dancing, they began to cry out, and beg him
to leave off; but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreaties,
till the judge not only gave him his life, but promised to return him
the hundred florins.

Then he called to the miser, and said, ‘Tell us now, you vagabond, where
you got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only,’ ‘I stole
it,’ said the miser in the presence of all the people; ‘I acknowledge
that I stole it, and that you earned it fairly.’ Then the countryman
stopped his fiddle, and left the miser to take his place at the gallows.

It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to
herself: ‘He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the
world,’ she spoke to him in a friendly way. ‘Good day, dear Mr Fox,
how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard
times?’ The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from
head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give
any answer or not. At last he said: ‘Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you
piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have
you the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How
many arts do you understand?’ ‘I understand but one,’ replied the
cat, modestly. ‘What art is that?’ asked the fox. ‘When the hounds are
following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.’ ‘Is that all?’
said the fox. ‘I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain
a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will
teach you how people get away from the hounds.’ Just then came a hunter
with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top
of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. ‘Open your
sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,’ cried the cat to him, but the dogs had
already seized him, and were holding him fast. ‘Ah, Mr Fox,’ cried the
cat. ‘You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been
able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.’

","In a small village, there lived an old woman who had a magical cow. This cow produced milk so rich and creamy that it could cure any illness. One day, the old woman decided to sell the cow to a wealthy merchant in a distant land. She packed the cow in a large wooden crate and set off on her journey.

As she walked, she came across a river too wide to cross. She sat down on the riverbank, feeling defeated. Suddenly, a wise old toad appeared beside her. ""What troubles you, dear lady?"" the toad asked. ""I cannot cross this river to reach the merchant's city,"" the old woman replied.

The toad thought for a moment. ""I have a solution,"" he said. ""I will carry you on my back across the river. In return, I ask for a small portion of the magical milk when you sell the cow."" The old woman agreed, and the toad carried her across the river.

Upon reaching the merchant's city, the old woman sold the magical cow for a large sum of gold. She returned to the riverbank, where the toad was waiting. She gave the toad a small bowl of the magical milk, and the toad hopped away, grateful.

The old woman returned home, where she lived comfortably on the gold she had earned. But she always remembered the wise old toad and the kindness he had shown her.

One day, she fell ill. She remembered the magical milk and the toad. She packed a small bowl of milk and set off on her journey back to the river. When she reached the riverbank, the toad was not there. She called out for him, but there was no answer.

She sat down on the riverbank, feeling defeated once again. She opened the bowl of milk and drank it, hoping it would cure her. Suddenly, she felt a strange warmth spreading through her body. She looked up and saw the toad, transformed into a handsome prince.

""I have been watching over you,"" the prince said. ""I am the one who gave the magical cow to your grandmother long ago. I have been waiting for you to call upon me again.""

The old woman was amazed. ""But why did you help me?"" she asked. ""I was once cursed to live as a toad, and the only way to break the curse was for someone to give me a portion of the magical milk. You have saved me.""

The old woman was overjoyed. ""I am grateful beyond words,"" she said. ""What can I do to repay you?""

""I have no need for repayment,"" the prince replied. ""But I ask one thing of you. When you die, I want you to tell the story of how I helped you. In this way, my name will live on.""

The old woman agreed, and the prince transformed back into a toad. He hopped away, and the old woman returned home, feeling grateful and happy.

From that day on, the old woman told the story of the wise old toad and the magical milk to everyone who would listen. And whenever she fell ill, she would remember the prince and drink a small bowl of the magical milk, feeling the warmth spread through her body and the curse lift.

The king of a great land died, and left his queen to take care of their
only child. This child was a daughter, who was very beautiful; and her
mother loved her dearly, and was very kind to her. And there was a good
fairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her mother to watch
over her. When she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived a
great way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married, she
got ready to set off on her journey to his country. Then the queen her
mother, packed up a great many costly things; jewels, and gold, and
silver; trinkets, fine dresses, and in short everything that became a
royal bride. And she gave her a waiting-maid to ride with her, and give
her into the bridegroom’s hands; and each had a horse for the journey.
Now the princess’s horse was the fairy’s gift, and it was called Falada,
and could speak.

When the time came for them to set out, the fairy went into her
bed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair,
and gave it to the princess, and said, ‘Take care of it, dear child; for
it is a charm that may be of use to you on the road.’ Then they all took
a sorrowful leave of the princess; and she put the lock of hair into
her bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her
bridegroom’s kingdom.

One day, as they were riding along by a brook, the princess began to
feel very thirsty: and she said to her maid, ‘Pray get down, and fetch
me some water in my golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to
drink.’ ‘Nay,’ said the maid, ‘if you are thirsty, get off yourself, and
stoop down by the water and drink; I shall not be your waiting-maid any
longer.’ Then she was so thirsty that she got down, and knelt over the
little brook, and drank; for she was frightened, and dared not bring out
her golden cup; and she wept and said, ‘Alas! what will become of me?’
And the lock answered her, and said:

 ‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,
  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’

But the princess was very gentle and meek, so she said nothing to her
maid’s ill behaviour, but got upon her horse again.

Then all rode farther on their journey, till the day grew so warm, and
the sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel very thirsty again;
and at last, when they came to a river, she forgot her maid’s rude
speech, and said, ‘Pray get down, and fetch me some water to drink in
my golden cup.’ But the maid answered her, and even spoke more haughtily
than before: ‘Drink if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid.’
Then the princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse, and lay
down, and held her head over the running stream, and cried and said,
‘What will become of me?’ And the lock of hair answered her again:

 ‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,
  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’

And as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom,
and floated away with the water. Now she was so frightened that she did
not see it; but her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew the
charm; and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power, now that
she had lost the hair. So when the bride had done drinking, and would
have got upon Falada again, the maid said, ‘I shall ride upon Falada,
and you may have my horse instead’; so she was forced to give up her
horse, and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on her
maid’s shabby ones.

At last, as they drew near the end of their journey, this treacherous
servant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what had
happened. But Falada saw it all, and marked it well.

Then the waiting-maid got upon Falada, and the real bride rode upon the
other horse, and they went on in this way till at last they came to the
royal court. There was great joy at their coming, and the prince flew to
meet them, and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the one
who was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to the royal chamber;
but the true princess was told to stay in the court below.

Now the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do; so he
amused himself by sitting at his kitchen window, looking at what was
going on; and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked very pretty,
and too delicate for a waiting-maid, he went up into the royal chamber
to ask the bride who it was she had brought with her, that was thus left
standing in the court below. ‘I brought her with me for the sake of her
company on the road,’ said she; ‘pray give the girl some work to do,
that she may not be idle.’ The old king could not for some time think
of any work for her to do; but at last he said, ‘I have a lad who takes
care of my geese; she may go and help him.’ Now the name of this lad,
that the real bride was to help in watching the king’s geese, was
Curdken.

But the false bride said to the prince, ‘Dear husband, pray do me one
piece of kindness.’ ‘That I will,’ said the prince. ‘Then tell one of
your slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon, for it
was very unruly, and plagued me sadly on the road’; but the truth was,
she was very much afraid lest Falada should some day or other speak, and
tell all she had done to the princess. She carried her point, and the
faithful Falada was killed; but when the true princess heard of it, she
wept, and begged the man to nail up Falada’s head against a large
dark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every morning
and evening, that there she might still see him sometimes. Then the
slaughterer said he would do as she wished; and cut off the head, and
nailed it up under the dark gate.

Early the next morning, as she and Curdken went out through the gate,
she said sorrowfully:

 ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’

and the head answered:

 ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!
  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,
  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’

Then they went out of the city, and drove the geese on. And when she
came to the meadow, she sat down upon a bank there, and let down her
waving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver; and when Curdken
saw it glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have pulled some of the
locks out, but she cried:

 ‘Blow, breezes, blow!
  Let Curdken’s hat go!
  Blow, breezes, blow!
  Let him after it go!
  O’er hills, dales, and rocks,
  Away be it whirl’d
  Till the silvery locks
  Are all comb’d and curl’d!

Then there came a wind, so strong that it blew off Curdken’s hat; and
away it flew over the hills: and he was forced to turn and run after
it; till, by the time he came back, she had done combing and curling her
hair, and had put it up again safe. Then he was very angry and sulky,
and would not speak to her at all; but they watched the geese until it
grew dark in the evening, and then drove them homewards.

The next morning, as they were going through the dark gate, the poor
girl looked up at Falada’s head, and cried:

 ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’

and the head answered:

 ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!
  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,
  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’

Then she drove on the geese, and sat down again in the meadow, and began
to comb out her hair as before; and Curdken ran up to her, and wanted to
take hold of it; but she cried out quickly:

 ‘Blow, breezes, blow!
  Let Curdken’s hat go!
  Blow, breezes, blow!
  Let him after it go!
  O’er hills, dales, and rocks,
  Away be it whirl’d
  Till the silvery locks
  Are all comb’d and curl’d!

Then the wind came and blew away his hat; and off it flew a great way,
over the hills and far away, so that he had to run after it; and when
he came back she had bound up her hair again, and all was safe. So they
watched the geese till it grew dark.

In the evening, after they came home, Curdken went to the old king, and
said, ‘I cannot have that strange girl to help me to keep the geese any
longer.’ ‘Why?’ said the king. ‘Because, instead of doing any good, she
does nothing but tease me all day long.’ Then the king made him tell him
what had happened. And Curdken said, ‘When we go in the morning through
the dark gate with our flock of geese, she cries and talks with the head
of a horse that hangs upon the wall, and says:

 ‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’

and the head answers:

 ‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!
  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,
  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’

And Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon the meadow
where the geese fed; how his hat was blown away; and how he was forced
to run after it, and to leave his flock of geese to themselves. But the
old king told the boy to go out again the next day: and when morning
came, he placed himself behind the dark gate, and heard how she spoke
to Falada, and how Falada answered. Then he went into the field, and
hid himself in a bush by the meadow’s side; and he soon saw with his own
eyes how they drove the flock of geese; and how, after a little time,
she let down her hair that glittered in the sun. And then he heard her
say:

 ‘Blow, breezes, blow!
  Let Curdken’s hat go!
  Blow, breezes, blow!
  Let him after it go!
  O’er hills, dales, and rocks,
  Away be it whirl’d
  Till the silvery locks
  Are all comb’d and curl’d!

And soon came a gale of wind, and carried away Curdken’s hat, and away
went Curdken after it, while the girl went on combing and curling her
hair. All this the old king saw: so he went home without being seen; and
when the little goose-girl came back in the evening he called her aside,
and asked her why she did so: but she burst into tears, and said, ‘That
I must not tell you or any man, or I shall lose my life.’

But the old king begged so hard, that she had no peace till she had told
him all the tale, from beginning to end, word for word. And it was very
lucky for her that she did so, for when she had done the king ordered
royal clothes to be put upon her, and gazed on her with wonder, she was
so beautiful. Then he called his son and told him that he had only a
false bride; for that she was merely a waiting-maid, while the true
bride stood by. And the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty, and
heard how meek and patient she had been; and without saying anything to
the false bride, the king ordered a great feast to be got ready for all
his court. The bridegroom sat at the top, with the false princess on one
side, and the true one on the other; but nobody knew her again, for her
beauty was quite dazzling to their eyes; and she did not seem at all
like the little goose-girl, now that she had her brilliant dress on.

When they had eaten and drank, and were very merry, the old king said
he would tell them a tale. So he began, and told all the story of the
princess, as if it was one that he had once heard; and he asked the
true waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who would
behave thus. ‘Nothing better,’ said this false bride, ‘than that she
should be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and that
two white horses should be put to it, and should drag it from street to
street till she was dead.’ ‘Thou art she!’ said the old king; ‘and as
thou has judged thyself, so shall it be done to thee.’ And the young
king was then married to his true wife, and they reigned over the
kingdom in peace and happiness all their lives; and the good fairy came
to see them, and restored the faithful Falada to life again.
There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so
the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he
did spill a little of anything.

It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to
herself: ‘He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the
world,’ she spoke to him in a friendly way. ‘Good day, dear Mr Fox,
how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard
times?’ The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from
head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give
any answer or not. At last he said: ‘Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you
piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have
you the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How
many arts do you understand?’ ‘I understand but one,’ replied the
cat, modestly. ‘What art is that?’ asked the fox. ‘When the hounds are
following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.’ ‘Is that all?’
said the fox. ‘I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain
a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will
teach you how people get away from the hounds.’ Just then came a hunter
with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top
of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. ‘Open your
sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,’ cried the cat to him, but the dogs had
already seized him, and were holding him fast. ‘Ah, Mr Fox,’ cried the
cat. ‘You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been
able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.’

","There was once a poor woodcutter, who lived in a small hut with his wife and their only daughter. The girl was very beautiful, and her mother loved her dearly. One day, the king of a far-off land came to visit the woodcutter, and he was so struck by the girl's beauty that he asked for her hand in marriage. The woodcutter and his wife were overjoyed, and the girl was filled with excitement at the prospect of becoming a queen.

On the day of the wedding, the woodcutter and his wife packed up many costly things - jewels, gold, and silver - to give to their daughter as a dowry. They also gave her a waiting-maid to accompany her on the journey to the king's castle. The girl mounted her horse, and the procession set off.

As they traveled, the girl became very thirsty, and she asked her waiting-maid to fetch her some water. But the waiting-maid was cruel, and she refused. The girl dismounted and knelt by a stream to drink, and as she did so, the waiting-maid took a lock of the girl's hair and threw it into the water.

The girl continued on her journey, but she was now without the protection of the lock of hair, which had been a charm given to her by a good fairy. As they approached the castle, the waiting-maid revealed her true nature, and she demanded that the girl hand over her dowry to her, or she would kill her. The girl begged for mercy, but the waiting-maid was cruel, and she took the girl's jewels, gold, and silver, and left her penniless.

The girl was forced to work as a servant in the castle, and she was treated cruelly by the other servants. But one day, as she was sweeping the floor, she overheard the king and queen talking. The queen was lamenting the fact that her daughter, the princess, had disappeared, and the king was offering a reward for anyone who could find her.

The girl's heart was filled with hope, and she went to the king and told him her story. The king was amazed, and he ordered the waiting-maid to be arrested and brought before him. The waiting-maid confessed her crimes, and the girl was reunited with her family.

The king was so grateful to the girl for revealing the truth that he offered to make her his queen instead of his daughter. But the girl declined, and she returned to her woodcutter father, who was overjoyed to have her back. The End."

There was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich
peasants, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant. He
had not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and
yet he and his wife did so wish to have one. One day he said to her:
‘Listen, I have a good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall
make us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like any
other, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow.’ the woman
also liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed
the calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its head
hanging down as if it were eating.

Next morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant
called the cow-herd in and said: ‘Look, I have a little calf there,
but it is still small and has to be carried.’ The cow-herd said: ‘All
right,’ and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set
it among the grass. The little calf always remained standing like one
which was eating, and the cow-herd said: ‘It will soon run by itself,
just look how it eats already!’ At night when he was going to drive the
herd home again, he said to the calf: ‘If you can stand there and eat
your fill, you can also go on your four legs; I don’t care to drag you
home again in my arms.’ But the little peasant stood at his door, and
waited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through
the village, and the calf was missing, he inquired where it was. The
cow-herd answered: ‘It is still standing out there eating. It would not
stop and come with us.’ But the little peasant said: ‘Oh, but I must
have my beast back again.’ Then they went back to the meadow together,
but someone had stolen the calf, and it was gone. The cow-herd said: ‘It
must have run away.’ The peasant, however, said: ‘Don’t tell me
that,’ and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his carelessness
condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away.

And now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had
so long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for
it, and could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed. They
salted the flesh, and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell
the skin there, so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds. On
the way he passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings,
and out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin. But as the
weather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could
go no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter. The
miller’s wife was alone in the house, and said to the peasant: ‘Lay
yourself on the straw there,’ and gave him a slice of bread and cheese.
The peasant ate it, and lay down with his skin beside him, and the woman
thought: ‘He is tired and has gone to sleep.’ In the meantime came the
parson; the miller’s wife received him well, and said: ‘My husband is
out, so we will have a feast.’ The peasant listened, and when he heard
them talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make
shift with a slice of bread and cheese. Then the woman served up four
different things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine.

Just as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking
outside. The woman said: ‘Oh, heavens! It is my husband!’ she quickly
hid the roast meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the pillow,
the salad on the bed, the cakes under it, and the parson in the closet
on the porch. Then she opened the door for her husband, and said: ‘Thank
heaven, you are back again! There is such a storm, it looks as if the
world were coming to an end.’ The miller saw the peasant lying on the
straw, and asked, ‘What is that fellow doing there?’ ‘Ah,’ said the
wife, ‘the poor knave came in the storm and rain, and begged for
shelter, so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese, and showed him where
the straw was.’ The man said: ‘I have no objection, but be quick and get
me something to eat.’ The woman said: ‘But I have nothing but bread and
cheese.’ ‘I am contented with anything,’ replied the husband, ‘so far as
I am concerned, bread and cheese will do,’ and looked at the peasant and
said: ‘Come and eat some more with me.’ The peasant did not require to
be invited twice, but got up and ate. After this the miller saw the skin
in which the raven was, lying on the ground, and asked: ‘What have you
there?’ The peasant answered: ‘I have a soothsayer inside it.’ ‘Can
he foretell anything to me?’ said the miller. ‘Why not?’ answered
the peasant: ‘but he only says four things, and the fifth he keeps to
himself.’ The miller was curious, and said: ‘Let him foretell something
for once.’ Then the peasant pinched the raven’s head, so that he croaked
and made a noise like krr, krr. The miller said: ‘What did he say?’ The
peasant answered: ‘In the first place, he says that there is some wine
hidden under the pillow.’ ‘Bless me!’ cried the miller, and went there
and found the wine. ‘Now go on,’ said he. The peasant made the raven
croak again, and said: ‘In the second place, he says that there is some
roast meat in the tiled stove.’ ‘Upon my word!’ cried the miller, and
went thither, and found the roast meat. The peasant made the raven
prophesy still more, and said: ‘Thirdly, he says that there is some
salad on the bed.’ ‘That would be a fine thing!’ cried the miller, and
went there and found the salad. At last the peasant pinched the raven
once more till he croaked, and said: ‘Fourthly, he says that there
are some cakes under the bed.’ ‘That would be a fine thing!’ cried the
miller, and looked there, and found the cakes.

And now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller’s wife
was frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with
her. The miller would have liked much to know the fifth, but the little
peasant said: ‘First, we will quickly eat the four things, for the fifth
is something bad.’ So they ate, and after that they bargained how much
the miller was to give for the fifth prophecy, until they agreed on
three hundred talers. Then the peasant once more pinched the raven’s
head till he croaked loudly. The miller asked: ‘What did he say?’ The
peasant replied: ‘He says that the Devil is hiding outside there in
the closet on the porch.’ The miller said: ‘The Devil must go out,’ and
opened the house-door; then the woman was forced to give up the keys,
and the peasant unlocked the closet. The parson ran out as fast as he
could, and the miller said: ‘It was true; I saw the black rascal with my
own eyes.’ The peasant, however, made off next morning by daybreak with
the three hundred talers.

At home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful
house, and the peasants said: ‘The small peasant has certainly been to
the place where golden snow falls, and people carry the gold home in
shovels.’ Then the small peasant was brought before the mayor, and
bidden to say from whence his wealth came. He answered: ‘I sold my cow’s
skin in the town, for three hundred talers.’ When the peasants heard
that, they too wished to enjoy this great profit, and ran home, killed
all their cows, and stripped off their skins in order to sell them in
the town to the greatest advantage. The mayor, however, said: ‘But my
servant must go first.’ When she came to the merchant in the town, he
did not give her more than two talers for a skin, and when the others
came, he did not give them so much, and said: ‘What can I do with all
these skins?’

Then the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus
outwitted them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused him of this
treachery before the mayor. The innocent little peasant was unanimously
sentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the water, in a barrel
pierced full of holes. He was led forth, and a priest was brought who
was to say a mass for his soul. The others were all obliged to retire to
a distance, and when the peasant looked at the priest, he recognized the
man who had been with the miller’s wife. He said to him: ‘I set you free
from the closet, set me free from the barrel.’ At this same moment up
came, with a flock of sheep, the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had
long been wishing to be mayor, so he cried with all his might: ‘No, I
will not do it; if the whole world insists on it, I will not do it!’ The
shepherd hearing that, came up to him, and asked: ‘What are you about?
What is it that you will not do?’ The peasant said: ‘They want to make
me mayor, if I will but put myself in the barrel, but I will not do it.’
The shepherd said: ‘If nothing more than that is needful in order to be
mayor, I would get into the barrel at once.’ The peasant said: ‘If you
will get in, you will be mayor.’ The shepherd was willing, and got in,
and the peasant shut the top down on him; then he took the shepherd’s
flock for himself, and drove it away. The parson went to the crowd,
and declared that the mass had been said. Then they came and rolled the
barrel towards the water. When the barrel began to roll, the shepherd
cried: ‘I am quite willing to be mayor.’ They believed no otherwise than
that it was the peasant who was saying this, and answered: ‘That is
what we intend, but first you shall look about you a little down below
there,’ and they rolled the barrel down into the water.

After that the peasants went home, and as they were entering the
village, the small peasant also came quietly in, driving a flock of
sheep and looking quite contented. Then the peasants were astonished,
and said: ‘Peasant, from whence do you come? Have you come out of the
water?’ ‘Yes, truly,’ replied the peasant, ‘I sank deep, deep down,
until at last I got to the bottom; I pushed the bottom out of the
barrel, and crept out, and there were pretty meadows on which a number
of lambs were feeding, and from thence I brought this flock away with
me.’ Said the peasants: ‘Are there any more there?’ ‘Oh, yes,’ said he,
‘more than I could want.’ Then the peasants made up their minds that
they too would fetch some sheep for themselves, a flock apiece, but the
mayor said: ‘I come first.’ So they went to the water together, and just
then there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which
are called little lambs, and they were reflected in the water, whereupon
the peasants cried: ‘We already see the sheep down below!’ The mayor
pressed forward and said: ‘I will go down first, and look about me, and
if things promise well I’ll call you.’ So he jumped in; splash! went
the water; it sounded as if he were calling them, and the whole crowd
plunged in after him as one man. Then the entire village was dead, and
the small peasant, as sole heir, became a rich man.
There was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest:
but still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he
had in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of
shoes.

Then he cut his leather out, all ready to make up the next day, meaning
to rise early in the morning to his work. His conscience was clear and
his heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed,
left all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep. In the morning after
he had said his prayers, he sat himself down to his work; when, to his
great wonder, there stood the shoes all ready made, upon the table. The
good man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening.
He looked at the workmanship; there was not one false stitch in the
whole job; all was so neat and true, that it was quite a masterpiece.

The same day a customer came in, and the shoes suited him so well that
he willingly paid a price higher than usual for them; and the poor
shoemaker, with the money, bought leather enough to make two pairs more.
In the evening he cut out the work, and went to bed early, that he might
get up and begin betimes next day; but he was saved all the trouble, for
when he got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand. Soon
in came buyers, who paid him handsomely for his goods, so that he bought
leather enough for four pair more. He cut out the work again overnight
and found it done in the morning, as before; and so it went on for some
time: what was got ready in the evening was always done by daybreak, and
the good man soon became thriving and well off again.

One evening, about Christmas-time, as he and his wife were sitting over
the fire chatting together, he said to her, ‘I should like to sit up and
watch tonight, that we may see who it is that comes and does my work for
me.’ The wife liked the thought; so they left a light burning, and hid
themselves in a corner of the room, behind a curtain that was hung up
there, and watched what would happen.

As soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs; and
they sat themselves upon the shoemaker’s bench, took up all the work
that was cut out, and began to ply with their little fingers, stitching
and rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that the shoemaker was all
wonder, and could not take his eyes off them. And on they went, till the
job was quite done, and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table.
This was long before daybreak; and then they bustled away as quick as
lightning.

The next day the wife said to the shoemaker. ‘These little wights have
made us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them a good
turn if we can. I am quite sorry to see them run about as they do; and
indeed it is not very decent, for they have nothing upon their backs to
keep off the cold. I’ll tell you what, I will make each of them a shirt,
and a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain; and
do you make each of them a little pair of shoes.’

The thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening, when
all the things were ready, they laid them on the table, instead of the
work that they used to cut out, and then went and hid themselves, to
watch what the little elves would do.

About midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the
room, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they
saw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed
mightily delighted.

Then they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and danced and
capered and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at last they danced
out at the door, and away over the green.

The good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them
from that time forward, as long as they lived.

","Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived a poor baker named Hans. He worked tirelessly, day and night, to provide for his wife and children, but his meager earnings were never enough. One day, as Hans was about to go to bed, he had only enough dough left to bake one loaf of bread. He sighed, said his prayers, and went to sleep, leaving the dough on the table.

In the morning, when he awoke, he found a beautifully baked loaf of bread, fresh and warm, sitting on the table. Hans was astonished, but he quickly sold the bread for a high price and used the money to buy more dough. The next day, he found two loaves of bread, and the day after that, four. Hans became rich, and his family lived comfortably.

One evening, as Hans and his wife sat by the fire, she suggested that they should make clothes for the mysterious baker who was helping them. Hans agreed, and they made two sets of clothes: a shirt, a coat, a waistcoat, and a pair of pants for each set. They left the clothes on the table, and hid to watch what would happen.

As soon as it was midnight, two tiny gnomes appeared. They saw the clothes and laughed with joy. They quickly dressed themselves and danced out of the bakery, disappearing into the night.

From that day forward, Hans and his family lived happily, and they never saw the gnomes again.

Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone
who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was
nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a
little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never
wear anything else; so she was always called ‘Little Red-Cap.’

One day her mother said to her: ‘Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece
of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill
and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and
when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path,
or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will
get nothing; and when you go into her room, don’t forget to say, “Good
morning”, and don’t peep into every corner before you do it.’

‘I will take great care,’ said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave
her hand on it.

The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village,
and just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red-Cap
did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of
him.

‘Good day, Little Red-Cap,’ said he.

‘Thank you kindly, wolf.’

‘Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?’

‘To my grandmother’s.’

‘What have you got in your apron?’

‘Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to
have something good, to make her stronger.’

‘Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?’

‘A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands
under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you
surely must know it,’ replied Little Red-Cap.

The wolf thought to himself: ‘What a tender young creature! what a nice
plump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must
act craftily, so as to catch both.’ So he walked for a short time by
the side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said: ‘See, Little Red-Cap, how
pretty the flowers are about here--why do you not look round? I believe,
too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you
walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else
out here in the wood is merry.’

Little Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing
here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere,
she thought: ‘Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would
please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there
in good time’; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for
flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a
still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and
deeper into the wood.

Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother’s house and knocked
at the door.

‘Who is there?’

‘Little Red-Cap,’ replied the wolf. ‘She is bringing cake and wine; open
the door.’

‘Lift the latch,’ called out the grandmother, ‘I am too weak, and cannot
get up.’

The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a
word he went straight to the grandmother’s bed, and devoured her. Then
he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed
and drew the curtains.

Little Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers,
and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she
remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.

She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she
went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to
herself: ‘Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like
being with grandmother so much.’ She called out: ‘Good morning,’ but
received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.
There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and
looking very strange.

‘Oh! grandmother,’ she said, ‘what big ears you have!’

‘The better to hear you with, my child,’ was the reply.

‘But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!’ she said.

‘The better to see you with, my dear.’

‘But, grandmother, what large hands you have!’

‘The better to hug you with.’

‘Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!’

‘The better to eat you with!’

And scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of
bed and swallowed up Red-Cap.

When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed,
fell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing
the house, and thought to himself: ‘How the old woman is snoring! I must
just see if she wants anything.’ So he went into the room, and when he
came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. ‘Do I find you
here, you old sinner!’ said he. ‘I have long sought you!’ Then just as
he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have
devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did
not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach
of the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips, he saw the little
Red-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl
sprang out, crying: ‘Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it was
inside the wolf’; and after that the aged grandmother came out alive
also, but scarcely able to breathe. Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched
great stones with which they filled the wolf’s belly, and when he awoke,
he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at
once, and fell dead.

Then all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf’s skin and
went home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which
Red-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap thought to herself: ‘As
long as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the
wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.’
A certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much
to her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at
length the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.
‘But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer
from hunger,’ said the cat; ‘and you, little mouse, cannot venture
everywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.’ The good advice
was followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where
to put it. At length, after much consideration, the cat said: ‘I know no
place where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one
dares take anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar,
and not touch it until we are really in need of it.’ So the pot was
placed in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great
yearning for it, and said to the mouse: ‘I want to tell you something,
little mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has
asked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold
him over the font at the christening. Let me go out today, and you look
after the house by yourself.’ ‘Yes, yes,’ answered the mouse, ‘by all
means go, and if you get anything very good to eat, think of me. I
should like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.’ All this,
however, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to
be godmother. She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat,
began to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off. Then she took a
walk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then
stretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought
of the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home.
‘Well, here you are again,’ said the mouse, ‘no doubt you have had a
merry day.’ ‘All went off well,’ answered the cat. ‘What name did they
give the child?’ ‘Top off!’ said the cat quite coolly. ‘Top off!’ cried
the mouse, ‘that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in
your family?’ ‘What does that matter,’ said the cat, ‘it is no worse
than Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.’

Before long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She said to
the mouse: ‘You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for
a day alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a
white ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.’ The good mouse consented,
but the cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured
half the pot of fat. ‘Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to
oneself,’ said she, and was quite satisfied with her day’s work. When
she went home the mouse inquired: ‘And what was the child christened?’
‘Half-done,’ answered the cat. ‘Half-done! What are you saying? I
never heard the name in my life, I’ll wager anything it is not in the
calendar!’

The cat’s mouth soon began to water for some more licking. ‘All good
things go in threes,’ said she, ‘I am asked to stand godmother again.
The child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that
exception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only
happens once every few years, you will let me go, won’t you?’ ‘Top-off!
Half-done!’ answered the mouse, ‘they are such odd names, they make me
very thoughtful.’ ‘You sit at home,’ said the cat, ‘in your dark-grey
fur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that’s because
you do not go out in the daytime.’ During the cat’s absence the mouse
cleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat entirely
emptied the pot of fat. ‘When everything is eaten up one has some
peace,’ said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not return
home till night. The mouse at once asked what name had been given to
the third child. ‘It will not please you more than the others,’ said the
cat. ‘He is called All-gone.’ ‘All-gone,’ cried the mouse ‘that is the
most suspicious name of all! I have never seen it in print. All-gone;
what can that mean?’ and she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay
down to sleep.

From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but
when the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found
outside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: ‘Come, cat,
we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves--we
shall enjoy that.’ ‘Yes,’ answered the cat, ‘you will enjoy it as much
as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the
window.’ They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of
fat certainly was still in its place, but it was empty. ‘Alas!’ said the
mouse, ‘now I see what has happened, now it comes to light! You are a true
friend! You have devoured all when you were standing godmother. First
top off, then half-done, then--’ ‘Will you hold your tongue,’ cried the
cat, ‘one word more, and I will eat you too.’ ‘All-gone’ was already on
the poor mouse’s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang
on her, seized her, and swallowed her down. Verily, that is the way of
the world.

There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so
the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he
did spill a little of anything.

It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to
herself: ‘He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the
world,’ she spoke to him in a friendly way. ‘Good day, dear Mr Fox,
how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard
times?’ The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from
head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give
any answer or not. At last he said: ‘Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you
piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have
you the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How
many arts do you understand?’ ‘I understand but one,’ replied the
cat, modestly. ‘What art is that?’ asked the fox. ‘When the hounds are
following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.’ ‘Is that all?’
said the fox. ‘I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain
a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will
teach you how people get away from the hounds.’ Just then came a hunter
with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top
of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. ‘Open your
sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,’ cried the cat to him, but the dogs had
already seized him, and were holding him fast. ‘Ah, Mr Fox,’ cried the
cat. ‘You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been
able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.’

","Once upon a time, there was a kind-hearted young girl named Greta. She was loved by everyone who met her, but her grandmother adored her the most. One day, Greta's mother asked her to take a basket of fresh bread to her grandmother's house, which was located deep within the forest.

""Greta, be careful,"" her mother warned. ""Stay on the path, and do not stray off into the woods, or you might lose your way. And when you arrive, remember to say 'Good morning' to your grandmother before you do anything else.""

Greta promised to be careful and set off on her journey. As she walked through the forest, she noticed a beautiful flower growing by the side of the path. She decided to pick it for her grandmother, and as she reached for it, she heard a rustling in the bushes.

A cunning fox stepped out from the undergrowth. ""Greta, my dear,"" he said. ""What a lovely day it is! Why are you in such a hurry? Take a moment to enjoy the beauty of the forest.""

Greta was unsure, but the fox seemed so friendly that she agreed to stay and talk with him for a while. As they chatted, the fox told her about his many cunning tricks and how he had outwitted many hunters.

""I could teach you some of my tricks, Greta,"" he said. ""Would you like that?""

Greta was flattered and agreed. The fox showed her how to hide from hunters by blending in with the trees and how to sneak up on unsuspecting prey.

""Now, remember what I have taught you, Greta,"" the fox said as she prepared to leave. ""You never know when you might need it.""

Greta thanked the fox and continued on her way. She arrived at her grandmother's house and found it dark and quiet. She called out ""Good morning,"" but there was no answer.

She cautiously entered the house and found her grandmother lying in bed, looking very pale. Greta rushed to her side and called out for help.

A hunter suddenly appeared in the doorway. ""I heard a cry for help,"" he said. ""What's wrong?""

Greta explained that her grandmother was ill, and the hunter immediately set to work, using his knowledge of herbs and potions to make her better.

As they waited for her grandmother to recover, Greta couldn't help but think about the fox and his tricks. She realized that while they might be useful in some situations, they could also be dangerous.

""I'm glad I didn't listen to the fox,"" she thought. ""I would have gotten into trouble if I had tried to use his tricks.""

When her grandmother finally woke up, Greta told her what had happened. Her grandmother smiled and said, ""I'm glad you didn't listen to the fox, Greta. It's important to be careful and think things through before we act.""

Greta nodded and promised to always remember her grandmother's words. From that day on, she was more cautious and thoughtful in everything she did.

","The Bremen Town Musicians

In a village lived a dog, a cat, a donkey, and a cock. They had long been old and had nobody who would take care of them, so they set out on the road to seek their livelihood as best they could. They had not gone far when they came to a farmyard where four young rascals were lying in wait to beat up anyone who came there. ‘What shall we do?’ said the dog, ‘the young rascals want to beat us, what a fine beginning we have made!’ ‘Let us go into the farmyard and into the barn,’ said the donkey, ‘and lie down behind the hayrack, and if anything happens we can run away quickly.’ So they did as he bid them, and lay down behind the hayrack. Soon after came the four young rascals with their cudgels in their hands, to beat the first that came and to take whatever he had about him. But as they did not see anyone, they thought there must be no one in the barn, and went to look for sticks and stones. Then the cat climbed up to the top of the hayrack, and clawed the eyes and noses of two of them, so that they screamed and ran away. The dog sprang on the two that were left, seized them by the tails, and shook them, so that they howled and were glad to let their sticks go. Then they took to their heels, and the dog, cat, donkey, and cock, came out and drove them away.

‘Now,’ said the donkey, ‘we have had some fun! I like this sort of thing!’ ‘Yes,’ said the others, ‘we too like it very much! Let us travel on a little farther, and if anything more happens we will do the same again.’

They had not gone far when they came to a garden where a lot of pigeons were sitting on the roof. ‘How beautifully they are sitting there!’ said the cock. ‘I should like to be just like them.’ ‘Cry,’ said the others, ‘if you are so fond of it, cry like a pigeon.’ So the cock began to cry as pigeons do, and when he had once begun he could not stop. Then the pigeons on the roof flew away, and down from the trees came all the birds--sparrows, chaffinches, larks, and all sorts of birds--and pecked at the cock till he was dead. ‘The End’ of the cock.

The others did not wait for that, but went on as fast as they could. When they had got a little farther, they came to a pond. ‘What a beautiful reflection in the water!’ said the cat. ‘I should like to sit there and wash myself.’ ‘Then do it,’ said the others, ‘if you like it, but take care that you do not go in up to your neck.’ The cat came to the pond, and as she was bent on washing herself, she sprang into it and made the most of things. But when she had once got in, she soon found out that it was not water, but oil, in which the cook had been frying fish. She wanted to get out, but she could not, and the cook came and poured more oil over her. In her fright she jumped high into the air, but she only made the ring round her neck slip, so that she was quite lost. ‘The End’ of the cat.

The dog and donkey were now alone. They thought they would rest a while, and the donkey stretched himself out and fell asleep. The dog thought he would take a walk, and when he had gone a little way, he saw a bone lying in the road. ‘What a good thing!’ said he, ‘now I have found something better than all the others.’ So he made the best of his time, and ate the bone, but he had not eaten it all when he felt himself quite paralysed, and a cart with two horses stood looking quite fixed in his eyes. It was not a cart, but a carrage, and in it lay a man who had been drunk the night before, and was now on his way home. He had taken the dog for a stone and the bone for a piece of wood, and had the driver put them on behind. But when the dog felt himself quite dead and saw nothing more of the bone, he began to be afraid, and tried to get up and to pull the carrage with the donkey, but it was of no use. ‘The End’ of the dog.

The donkey, who had been fast asleep, heard a noise, and when he awoke and saw what had happened, was greatly frightened, and began to bray. Then out came the cook and the driver, who took the dog and threw him down on the carrage, and drove off with him. ‘The End’ of the dog.

The donkey set off as fast as he could, and soon came to a town. ‘Here at any rate,’ he thought, ‘I shall be able to earn a living.’ So he went to the market-place, and as people were buying and selling all around him, he began to bray as loud as he could. At this a soldier came up to him and said, ‘Why do you make such a noise?’ ‘Because,’ said the donkey, ‘I am a musician, and am making ready to begin.’ ‘Can you play at anything in particular?’ asked the soldier. ‘Oh, yes!’ said the donkey, ‘I can play at everything that is played on the fiddle.’ ‘Then come with me,’ said the soldier, ‘and let us try that.’ So he took the donkey to an inn, and went in and asked the landlord if he had any fiddle. The landlord said, ‘No,’ he had not, but he would soon get one. Then the soldier took the donkey out again, and sat on a bench with him, and said, ‘Now, then, let us hear what you can do.’ ‘Wait,’ said the donkey, ‘until I have rested myself a little, I have journeyed a long way.’ When he had rested himself, the soldier again said, ‘Now, then, let us hear something.’ ‘Will not Mr Mayor come out here for a moment?’ said the donkey. The soldier sent someone to fetch the Mayor, and he soon came. ‘Why do you desire my presence, soldier?’ said he. ‘Because,’ said the soldier, ‘I have a musician here who wants to play to me, and I want to hear what he can do.’ ‘Is that all?’ said the Mayor. ‘I too am fond of music, so if the donkey can please the soldier, he will please me also.’ Then the donkey said, ‘Will not the sexton come and witness the performance?’ The sexton was sent for, and he came. ‘What is all this about?’ said he. ‘The soldier is going to have the donkey play to him, and as he does it so well for the soldier, he will do it for me also.’ ‘If the sexton is to be there,’ said the donkey, ‘I had better take a little walk first, or my lungs will not be cool enough.’ Then the three waited till he had taken his walk, and had cooled himself sufficiently. ‘Now, donkey,’ said the soldier, ‘come out and begin.’ ‘Just wait a little,’ said the donkey, ‘until I have put on my cloak,’ and he began to look for it. The soldier waited till he had looked for it for some time, and then said, ‘Donkey, why do you make yourself so important? Begin at once.’ ‘Now, then,’ said the donkey, and he began to bray. ‘That is well done,’ said the soldier. ‘Yes,’ said the Mayor, ‘that is well done.’ ‘Yes,’ said the sexton, ‘that is well done.’ ‘I too am pleased,’ said the cook, and came up. ‘What is going on here?’ said he. ‘The donkey is beginning his concert,’ said the soldier. ‘Is that you, rogue?’ said the"

","There was once a poor old woman who lived in a little cottage in the
woods. She had neither money, nor friends, nor relations in the world,
and was very unhappy. ‘What is the use of living,’ said she, ‘when one
has nothing to look forward to but misery and wretchedness?’ So she
decided to end her troubles by putting an end to herself.

She went out into the wood to find a suitable place, and when she had
walked a long way, she sat herself down under a tree, took out a
little knife, and was just going to make the cut, when she happened to
look up and see a little dwarf standing by her side.

‘Bless me!’ said the old woman, ‘who are you?’ ‘I am the little dwarf
of the wood,’ answered he; ‘why do you look so sad and woe-begone?’
‘Because I am so unhappy, and have nothing left to live for.’ ‘What
makes you so unhappy?’ ‘Poverty,’ said the old woman. ‘How do you manage
to live?’ ‘I gather wood and sell it; but what I get for it is not
enough to buy food with.’ ‘How many logs do you sell?’ ‘Seven,’ replied
the old woman. ‘Bring me seven logs tomorrow, and I will give you seven
talers for them.’ ‘Where will you take them to?’ said the old woman.
‘To my house.’ ‘If you will do as I say, I shall be very glad to have
your custom.’ Then the dwarf took the old woman home with him, and
treated her very kindly, and gave her a large room to live in, and as
much to eat as she could wish for.

The next day the dwarf went into his own country, and the old woman
had no one to buy her wood, so she did not know what to do, and was
very much worried. At last she cut down a young tree, and sat herself
down amongst the stumps and cried. Now, as she was sitting there,
another dwarf came up to her, and asked what was the matter. ‘Oh!’ said
the old woman, ‘I am so unhappy; I have no one to buy my wood, and I
know not what will become of me.’ ‘What do you want to sell wood for?’
said the dwarf. ‘Why, to buy food with.’ ‘How much do you ask for seven
logs?’ ‘Full price,’ answered the old woman. ‘I will give you full
price,’ said the dwarf; ‘but you must bring the wood to my house.’
‘Where does that come?’ ‘In the town.’ ‘How far is it?’ ‘A good hour’s
walk.’ So the old woman carried her wood to the town, and the dwarf
gave her full price for it, and then went back to his own country,
and the old woman was left again without anyone to buy her wood.

Then she cut down another tree, and sat down and cried over it as she
had done before, when on a sudden two dwarfs came up to her, and asked
what she was crying for. ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘I am so unhappy, for I have
no one to buy my wood, and I know not what will become of me.’ ‘What
do you want to sell wood for?’ said the dwarfs. ‘To buy food with.’ ‘How
much do you ask for seven logs?’ ‘Full price.’ ‘We will give it you,
but you must bring the wood to our house.’ ‘Where does that come?’
‘In the town.’ ‘How far is it?’ ‘A good hour’s walk.’ So the old woman
carried her wood to the town, and the two dwarfs paid her what she
asked, and then went back to their country, and the poor woman was
once more left to shift for herself.

Then she cut down a third tree, and sat down and cried over it as before,
when a merchant came by, and asked what she was doing. ‘Alas!’ said she,
‘I am so unhappy, for I have no one to buy my wood, and I know not what
will become of me.’ ‘What do you want to sell wood for?’ said the
merchant. ‘To buy food with.’ ‘How much do you ask for seven logs?’ ‘Full
price.’ ‘I will give it you,’ said the merchant; ‘but you must bring the
wood to my house.’ ‘Where does that come?’ ‘In the town.’ ‘How far is
it?’ ‘A good hour’s walk.’ So the old woman took her wood to the town,
and the merchant paid her what she asked, and then went his way, and
the poor woman was once more forsaken.

Then she cut down a fourth tree, and cried over it as she had done the
three others, when a huntsman came by, and asked what was the matter.
‘Alas!’ said she, ‘I am so unhappy, for I have no one to buy my wood,
and I know not what will become of me.’ ‘What do you want to sell wood
for?’ said the huntsman. ‘To buy food with.’ ‘How much do you ask for
seven logs?’ ‘Full price.’ ‘I will give it you,’ said the huntsman; ‘but
you must bring the wood to my house.’ ‘Where does that come?’ ‘In the
town.’ ‘How far is it?’ ‘A good hour’s walk.’ So the old woman took
her wood to the town, and the huntsman paid her what she asked, and
then went his way, and the poor woman was once more forsaken.

Then she cut down a fifth tree, and cried over it as before, when a
soldier came by, and asked what was the matter. ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘I am
so unhappy, for I have no one to buy my wood, and I know not what will
become of me.’ ‘What do you want to sell wood for?’ said the soldier.
‘To buy food with.’ ‘How much do you ask for seven logs?’ ‘Full price.’
‘I will give it you,’ said the soldier; ‘but you must bring the wood to
my barracks.’ ‘Where does that come?’ ‘In the town.’ ‘How far is it?’
‘A good hour’s walk.’ So the old woman took her wood to the town, and
the soldier paid her what she asked, and then went his way, and the
poor woman was once more forsaken.

Then she cut down a sixth tree, and cried over it as before, when a
fisher came by, and asked what was the matter. ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘I am
so unhappy, for I have no one to buy my wood, and I know not what will
become of me.’ ‘What do you want to sell wood for?’ said the fisher.
‘To buy food with.’ ‘How much do you ask for seven logs?’ ‘Full price.’
‘I will give it you,’ said the fisher; ‘but you must bring the wood to
my house.’ ‘Where does that come?’ ‘In the town.’ ‘How far is it?’
‘A good hour’s walk.’ So the old woman took her wood to the town, and
the fisher paid her what she asked, and then went his way, and the
poor woman was once more forsaken.

Then she cut down a seventh tree, and cried over it as before, when a
parliament of dwarfs came up to her, and asked what was the matter.
‘Alas!’ said she, ‘I am so unhappy, for I have no one to buy my wood,
and I know not what will become of me.’ ‘What do you want to sell wood
for?’ said the dwarfs. ‘To buy food with.’ ‘"

","There was once a king who had a beautiful garden full of all kinds of fine
flowers, and in the middle stood a large tree. It was so old that one of
its branches touched the sky. Every morning the king’s daughter went
there to take her walk, and when she had done, she always plucked herself
one flower from the garden, and one from the tree, and took them with her
in her lap to her father’s palace.

It happened one day that she plucked a flower from the tree as usual, but
as she was hurrying away with it, the stalk broke, and the flower fell
back into the garden. Then the tree cried out:

 ‘Wait, princess! wait! give me a reason
  Why the cherry tree, so gay and fine,
  Stands here alone, and is not adorned
  With one of thy flowers, so bright and rine!’

 ‘Bless me!’ said the princess, ‘how the
  tree can speak!’ But she went on still
  Hurrying to the palace. The next day
  She took care to bring the tree a flower
  In addition to one from the garden.
  And so it went on for some time: the
  King’s daughter always took two flowers
  Every day, one from the garden and
  One from the tree.

It happened that the princess did not come to the garden one day, but
the tree cried out as usual for its flower. Then a little old woman came
from out of the greenwood, and she plucked a flower for the tree, and said
as she did so: ‘Lady, you shall have a son who will cut off your head.’

The next morning the princess had a son, and seven days after she had a
daughter. Seven days after that, the old woman’s prophecy came true, and
she died. The king ordered the garden to be locked up, and no one was
allowed to go there any more.

The prince grew up, and the princess died, and the king likewise. Then
the prince inherited his father’s kingdom, and he and the princess’s
daughter inherited the garden. They cut down the old tree, for they did
not know that in its roots lived an old enemy, who cried out with a loud
voice: ‘Ah, false treel False tree!’ Three times he cried so, and then all
his strength was gone, and he died.

The prince and the princess’s daughter lived together very happily for a
while; but the princess’s daughter was very beautiful, and it happened
that many suitors came and asked her to marry them. At last one of them
said: ‘I will give you as many roses as there are stars in the sky, if
you will marry me.’ She answered: ‘I will do it, if it can be done.’ Then
the prince said: ‘It cannot be done, for there are so many stars that no
man can count them.’ The princess’s daughter said: ‘I will soon find out,
for I will go up into the heavens at midnight, and see for myself how
many stars there are.’

Then the prince was very sorrowful, and went down into his garden, and
kneeled before a little brook which ran through it, and prayed: ‘If it be
well for me that my dear sister should go into the heavens, that she may
count the stars, then show me some way to go with her.’ And as he prayed,
a little dwarf came out of the brook, and said: ‘True and faithful shall
I be unto thee; go into the garden, and cut down the old tree which is in
the corner, and out of the trunk shalt thou make a bow, and out of the
three largest roots nine arrows; and when thou drawest the bow, and shootest
the arrows, they shall be true and faithful, and carry thee through the
air wherever thou wilt.’

Then the prince did as the dwarf bade him, and took the bow and the nine
arrows, and went to his sister, and said: ‘I will go with you into the
heavens.’ But she said: ‘Alas! how can that be?’ He answered: ‘I have made
a bow and nine arrows, and when I draw the bow and shoot the arrows, we
shall be carried through the air wherever we will.’

Then she said: ‘If that be so, I will go with thee.’ So they went out
together, and he shot the first arrow up into the heavens, and they were
carried through the air upon a cloud as fast as the arrow went. And the
prince drew the bow again, and shot the second arrow, and they were carried
faster still; and so they went on, shooting the eight other arrows one
after another, until the bow was tired, and would draw no more.

Then the prince looked around him, and saw that the whole firmament was
covered with stars, and that his sister was not among them. So he drew the
bow again, and shot another arrow, and prayed that the arrow might carry
them to the moon, that his sister might count the stars upon it. So the
prince and the princess were carried to the moon, and landed on the top of
it, and there they found a garden full of roses, and in the middle stood
a bed that was even larger than the garden from which his mother had plucked
the first flower. Then the princess looked around at all the roses, and
said: ‘I can count these in one day.’

But the prince said: ‘I will run round to the end of the garden, and then
you shall begin to count.’ So he ran to the end of the garden, and it was
so large that he could not run round to the end of it in any time, but
stood still and waited for his sister, that she might begin to count. But
she said: ‘There are so many roses, that I cannot tell where to begin.’
Then the prince said: ‘Take one of the roses in your lap, and begin to
count from that.’ So she took one of the roses, and sat down and began to
count, but she had not counted up to seven before she found that she had
already taken the entire crop of roses from the bed in which they grew,
and laid them in her lap. And she said: ‘I cannot go home with these, for
they are so many that I cannot carry them.’

Then the prince shot another arrow from his bow, and the arrow flew to
the sun, and they were carried in the chariot of the sun through the
air to the earth, and landed in the garden from which the first flower
had been plucked. There stood the old garden full of flowers, and in the
middle stood the tree where the old enemy had died. And the princess
looked around at all the flowers, and said: ‘I will take with me one of
every kind of flower that grows here, and then I shall be able to go home
with them.’

Then the prince said: ‘Take as many as you will, but I must have one
more look round the garden.’ And as he looked round, he saw a beautiful
flower which he had not seen before, lying among the grass at the root
of the tree. So he bent down and plucked it, and took it with him.

Then the princess gathered together all the flowers, and laid them in
a heap, so that there was not one left in the whole garden. And she said
as she did so: ‘I can carry these home upon my lap, and then I shall have
enough to take with me.’ But the heap of flowers became smaller and
smaller, and at last there was not one flower left in the whole garden,
and the princess had nothing to take home with her.

Then the prince shot the last arrow out of his bow, and they were carried
back to the moon again, and landed in the same place where they had been
before. And the princess said: ‘"

","There was once a poor wood-cutter, who had one horse that could no longer work, and had therefore given it to some use to a butcher to be killed. When the wood-cutter went up to the town to settle the account, he took his little daughter with him. Now it chanced that the butcher wanted to try how the creature was cut up, and asked the wood-cutter whether he would like to go into the room and see how the horse was getting on. ‘Oh, yes,’ answered the man, ‘I should like to see it,’ and followed the butcher. When the butcher saw that the man was not at all affected by what he saw, he thought to himself that the horse must have been of little use for work, and cut up the animal without delay. But when the little girl was led outside again, she wept and wept over the blood that was flowing from the horse, and her tears flowed so plentifully that the butcher became uneasy, for he thought: ‘The little wretch will certainly cry herself to death.’ So he ordered the horse to be buried, and paid the father the price of the beast, and gave him something over and above into the bargain.

The little girl, however, did not comfort herself for the death of her beloved horse, and when she was left alone she would sit by the grave and weep. ‘Dear Bummel,’ she would say, ‘how could you let them kill you? You might have run away like the other horses.’ Then she would tell her dead friend all her sorrows, and as she lived in the outskirts of the town, there was no one to hinder her, and her father and mother were so poor that they could not provide her with a maid to keep her company.

One evening, as she sat by the grave, something suddenly caught her little finger in the dark, and she felt a coldness run down her arm. She drew her hand back hastily, and when she looked round saw a white horse standing at the grave. ‘Bummel!’ she cried, ‘is that you? Have you forsaken the grave? I am so glad to see you again!’ ‘Yes,’ answered the horse, ‘it is I. When you wept so bitterly for me, your tears fell into my grave, and as you so often came there and grieved for me, I have come back to you. But as you are still so young and small, I will grant you one wish. You must, however, make it quickly, for the cock will soon crow, and then I shall vanish again.’

The little girl was so overjoyed that she did not know what she should wish for, and at first she could think of nothing but her horse. ‘Then I wish,’ she said at last, ‘that Bummel might have a golden bridle with a collar of shining pearls.’ ‘Your wish is granted,’ said the horse, and as the wood-cutter and his wife were standing nearby, selling their wares, the man looked up and saw a horse standing in the middle of the town, with a golden bridle and a collar of shining pearls. ‘I should like to have that horse,’ said he to the woman, ‘but I have not so much money.’ ‘Just go up to the man,’ said the little girl, ‘and tell him that you will give him twice the price of the horse if he will wait for the gold I am to have from my wish.’ The wood-cutter did as his daughter bade him, and the butcher said: ‘I will wait for the gold,’ and the man paid him what the horse was worth, and took the beast home with him.

The next morning, the little girl went out to the horse, and said: ‘Bummel, now that you are so beautiful, the coachman will come and take you away, and I shall never see you again. I will therefore wish for a second thing. Think, and then I will make my wish.’ ‘Take your time,’ said the horse, ‘and think well of what you wish, for the cock will soon crow.’

The little girl thought for a long time, and at last said: ‘I wish that every year on New Year’s Eve, a piece of gold would come to us, as big as a man’s head.’ ‘Your wish is granted,’ said the horse, and before New Year’s Eve the wood-cutter had a large piece of gold standing in the corner, as big as a man’s head.

When New Year’s Eve came round, the wood-cutter and his wife were overjoyed, and said: ‘Our child is a true fairy, to be able to bring us that great piece of gold.’ And they thought: ‘If every year a piece of gold comes as big as a man’s head, we shall be rich some day.’

The little girl went out to the horse, and said: ‘Bummel, now I have my wish, and have you not any more power?’ ‘Yes,’ answered the horse, ‘but you must think well of something before the cock crows.’

The little girl thought for a long time, and at last said: ‘I wish that I might become a beautiful princess, and that a prince should come, who would take me for his wife, and love me as dearly as ever a man did a woman.’ ‘Your wish is granted,’ said the horse, and before the cock had crowed, the little wood-cutter’s girl was a beautiful princess, and a prince came, who took her for his wife, and loved her as dearly as ever a man did a woman.

The horse said to her: ‘Now you must go, for the cock is crowing, and I must go into the earth again.’ ‘Goodbye, Bummel,’ said the princess, ‘I shall never forget you.’ ‘I too,’ said the horse, ‘will never forget you, and as you have been so kind to me, I will grant you one more wish.’ ‘I have no wish to make,’ answered the princess, and went into the palace with the prince.

The horse went into the earth again, and the princess had a beautiful marble horse with a golden bridle and a collar of shining pearls, which still stands in the palace to this day, and sometimes at midnight, when the moon shines on it, it becomes alive and frisky, and anyone who then looks at it may wish for one thing, but he or she must think of it quickly, for the cock will soon crow."

","Once upon a time there was a king who had twelve beautiful daughters. They slept in twelve beds all in one room, and every morning before daybreak they rose up and did their work. Now it chanced that the king had a daughter who was fairer than all the others, and she lay in a bed by herself in a chamber on the top of the house; and when she arose in the morning, she went down a narrow staircase.

One morning, as the king was sitting in his hall, a feeling of uneasiness came over him, and he said to his court, ‘I should willingly see all my daughters this morning, that I may know whether they are all safe.’ Then the twelve servants went up one after another, and brought down the twelve princesses, but the twelfth came down alone. ‘It is well,’ said the king, ‘that I have seen you all, for I felt as if my heart was heavy within me.’

When the twelfth princess was gone, the king’s sense of uneasiness left him, and he forgot all about it; but the princess felt quite grateful to him for his care, and she took to heart his wish to know that she was safe, and was grieved to think that she should have been the twelfth, and that he had felt uneasy till he had seen her. So she arose very early the next morning, long before it was day, and went to her father, and kissed his hand, and said, ‘I am so grateful to you for your care, that I will never sleep in my bed any more, but will lie on the staircase below my chamber, that you may always see me as you passes up to your chair in the morning.’ Then the king was very glad, and said she should do as she pleased.

So the princess slept on the staircase, and in the morning the king saw her as he went to his chair.

Now it happened that the king held a great feast, and asked thither a nobleman who was a great sorcerer. And when the princess went down to the hall, the sorcerer looked at her and said, ‘You are the most beautiful of all the king’s daughters, but you must dance with me this evening, and you alone.’ Then she promised, and in the evening when the time came she danced with him. And he took her aside, and said, ‘Tell me true, where do you sleep?’ ‘On the staircase,’ said she. Then he said, ‘When you lie down there tonight, twelve men and women will come and carry you away from thence, and if I do not get you again by daybreak, you will never see your father’s palace any more.’

The sorcerer kept his word, and when she lay down that night, twelve men and women came and lifted her up, and carried her away. And they took her to a mill, and washed her with boiling water, that she might be held fast, but it did her no harm. Then they set her to grinding at the mill, and said, ‘You must work, and not stop until you are quite tired.’

But the princess ground at the mill until her heart was light within her, for she knew that daybreak was near, and that she should soon be free. And sure enough, before it was day, she sprang up from the mill, and went out, and the doors flew open, and she walked away quite at her ease.

She walked by a forest, and as she was very hungry she sat herself down under a tree and ate some of the berries. And as she was eating, a little old woman came up to her, and said, ‘Why do you eat the berries, pretty child?’ ‘Because I am very hungry,’ answered she. ‘If that be the case,’ said the little old woman, ‘come with me, and you shall fare well.’ Then she took her by the hand, and led her through the forest, and at last brought her to a little house.

There were twelve old women sitting in the parlour, all with long grey hair and shrivelled faces; but they rose up and welcomed her, and said, ‘Our sister has been a long time coming, and we thought she had forgotten us.’ Then they took her to a little bed, and she slept till it was noon.

When she awoke, they gave her food, and after she had eaten they said, ‘Tell us, pretty child, how it happened that you came here.’ So she told them all her story, how the sorcerer had carried her away, and how she had escaped by daybreak.

‘Well,’ said they, ‘now that you are with us, you must work hard, and do all the housekeeping; for we are spinners, and our work never ends. You must get ready the food, and wash the dishes, and do all the work of the house.’

Then she did all they told her, and worked hard, till her fingers bled, and at night she was so tired that she fell asleep.

The next morning, as day was breaking, she went to the door, and it flew wide open, and she walked out quite at her ease. Then she went on through the forest, and by noon she reached a great city, and passed through the streets till she came to the sea. And there stood a ship with black sails, and the sailors were making ready to sail. ‘What a beautiful ship,’ she said to herself, ‘if I could only get on board of her I should be happy.’

So she went to the captain, and said, ‘I will give you my ring as a gift, if you will let me go with you.’ Then he looked at her, and said, ‘You are very pretty, but what is there in your ring that it should be worth so much?’ ‘I will not tell you that,’ she answered, ‘unless you take me with you.’ Then the captain saw that she was bent on having her own way, and said, ‘Very well, I will let you go with us, for the sake of your ring.’

Then he showed her to the other sailors, and they all came to gaze at her; and she told them how she had been used, and how she had escaped.

When they came to the next town the captain said to her, ‘I have kept my word, and have brought you safely with me, so now you must tell me what the secret of your ring is.’ Then she said, ‘I will tell you if you will take me to my father’s country.’ ‘Where does your father live?’ asked he. ‘Far, far away,’ answered she. ‘How shall we find the way?’ ‘I will hold up my hand, and when it is quite full of stars, you must steer straight on, and you cannot go amiss.’

So they sailed on, and one night her hand was full of stars, and the captain steered straight on as she told him, and by daybreak they came to the country. Then she said, ‘I will go ashore alone, and you must stay here till I come back, and then you shall have your reward.’ So she jumped ashore, and the ship stood still.

She walked on through the forest till she came to the mill, and went in and said, ‘Open the doors, for it is I.’ Then the mill sprang open, and she went on to the king’s palace, and the doors flew open too, and all her brothers and sisters came running to meet her.

She told them all her adventures, and how she had been to the little old women, and how she had sailed away over the sea, and had come back to her own country again.

And now she went to her father, and told him all that had happened, and he was very glad to see her, for he thought he should never have her again. Then the sailors came home, and brought the ship safe into port, and the captain showed the king the beautiful ring which he had got as his reward.

And the king held a great feast, and gave his daughter to the nobleman who was a great sorcerer to wife, as he had before been willing to do; and the wedding was celebrated with great pomp and pleasure, and they lived together very happily"

","There was once a forester who had a faithful and diligent servant, called
Karl, who had been with him many years. The forester had a good deal of
money laid by, but had no child to be his heir, and as Karl had behaved
well, he thought he would make him his heir, and said to him one day, ‘I
am very glad to have you, and will always take care of you; but I have
something to tell you now which will make you very happy. I have long
looked upon you as a son, and as I have neither child nor brother, I will
make you my sole heir.’ Karl rejoiced at his master’s kindness, but said
nothing, and seemed very much affected.

Some time after, the forester sent Karl to the town to bring away a
casket which was to be his reward. Karl did as he was told, but when he
came back and was going to give his master the key of the casket, he
found that it was locked, and that there was no key. He was very much
grieved, and did not know what to do, for he saw that his master would
be very angry. At last he thought of a little black boy who lived in the
village, who had once told him that he could find out all secrets, and
could open and shut with a key any casket or box, however hard it might
be. So he took the casket and went to the boy, who soon opened it, and
when Karl looked inside he found it was full of gold. Then he was very
glad, and took the casket to his master.

The forester was well pleased, and said, ‘Now, Karl, you shall have
all that is in the casket, and I will make you my heir.’ ‘Lord and Master,
I will never take a penny of your money,’ said Karl; ‘I am very grateful
to you for what you have done for me already, but I would rather die
than take so great a fortune.’ ‘Nonsense!’ said the forester, ‘you shall
take it, and I will have it as well as given. Sit yourself there on
the bench, and think about it, and don’t go away till you have made up
your mind.’

Karl sat down, but he could think of nothing else all day long, and the
next day he was just the same. At last on the third day, when he thought
he should go mad for thinking, he went to his master, and said, ‘Lord
and Master, as you love me, and as I am so sorry to part with you, I will
go away into the wide world, and if I live I will never come back.’ ‘Well,
Karl,’ said the forester, ‘if that is what you wish, go, but before you
go I will give you a piece of advice. Take care of yourself, and mind and
trust no one.’ ‘I will do all that, lord and master,’ said Karl.

Then the forester gave him a loaf of bread, a piece of bacon, a knife, a
fowling-piece, and a bag, and said, ‘Take that with you, and travel on
till you come to a great wood; in the middle of the wood there is a house
where lives an old woman. Go to her, and let nothing she may say or do
dismay you. If you will do what she tells you, you will fare well.’

Karl thanked his master once more, and then set out, and when he came
to the great wood, he went into the middle of it, and there, just as his
master had told him, he saw the old woman’s house. As he was very hungry
he went in and said, ‘I am very hungry, do pray give me something to eat.’
‘What will you have?’ said the old woman. ‘I have a hen that has just
laid an egg, and I will give it you fried.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said
Karl, ‘that will be very nice.’ So she killed the hen, and fried it with
the egg, and when it was ready she said, ‘Now, Karl, as you like fowls
so well, will you not go and look out for some for me? There is a great
flock of them close by, but they are very hard to catch, for they never
keep still, and fly about from tree to tree.’ ‘I will soon find a way to
tame them,’ said Karl, ‘and then it will be an easy thing to catch them.’

Then the old woman led him into the wood, and showed him the flock of
hens, and as they were flying about, Karl fired into them with his
fowling-piece, and killed one. ‘Now,’ said he, ‘take up that hen, and tie
her legs and wings together, and hang her up in a tree, and tomorrow morning
before daylight tie the other hens close to her, and then they will think
that she is still flying about, and will not dare to stir.’

The old woman did as he told her, and next morning before daylight Karl
took them all and brought them to her house, where he killed and dressed
them, and then said, ‘Now, old woman, you must keep what you have
promised me.’ ‘What is that?’ said she. ‘Why,’ said he, ‘you must give
me a bed to lie on, and some to eat and drink.’ ‘Very well,’ said the
old woman, ‘but who will give you that?’ ‘You must,’ answered Karl.

Then the old woman fetched him a bed, and some bread and cheese to eat,
and a flask of wine, and said, ‘There, now be off, I have done all I could
for you.’ ‘One more thing,’ said Karl, ‘before you go, tell me where the
treasure is that is hidden in the wood.’ ‘What treasure?’ said the old
woman. ‘Why, the one that my master told me of when I went away from
him.’ ‘Ah!’ said the old woman, ‘you would not have that, would you?
You must work for that. Go out tomorrow very early, and you will see
three old men coming into the wood. Let them come up to you, and then
shoot at them with your fowling-piece, and as they will want to run away,
run after them, and bind them fast, and when you have bound all three,
go to their prison, and in the twelfth box that you find there, you
will see the treasure you want so much.’

Karl did as the old woman told him, and when he had bound the three old
men and got the treasure, he thought he should be very glad to have it,
and went back to the old woman. ‘Now, old woman, have you anything more
to say to me?’ said he. ‘Nothing at all,’ answered she, ‘but as you are
so clever, and have done everything I told you, you shall have something
more. You see that there is a great hill behind my house; go up to the top
of it, and in the middle of it you will find a millstone. Bring that
away, and you will find a little house close by, where lives an old woman
with a black cat. Go in and give her the millstone, and she will give
you a piece of bread and cheese, and a flask of wine, and will tell you
where the gold and silver mountain is, which you want so much.’

Karl did as she told him, and when he came back she said, ‘Now, Karl,
you have done all I could ask or wish, and as you have been so clever,
you shall have one more piece of advice. Go out early tomorrow morning,
and you will see three men coming into the wood. Let them come up to you,
and then shoot at them with your fowling-piece, and"

","The Snow Queen

In a land that was half rock and half forest, there lived a poor old woman. She was so poor that she could not even afford glass for her windows, so she cut out little squares of mica instead.

One day, when the snow had fallen deep, she was clearing her cottage before the fire, when a dazzlingly beautiful child came in. It was the Snow Queen, and she had come to visit the earth. She walked on the snow without leaving a track behind her, and her clothes and hair were like the snow itself.

She looked around at the poor cottage, and then she laughed, for she saw how very poor the old woman was. ‘Pray, old woman, give me some of your fire,’ said she. ‘Nay,’ answered the old woman, ‘it will burn you.’ ‘Just a little,’ said the Snow Queen. The old woman was afraid, and took care not to give her any fire, but only blew the ashes and smoke in her face. Then the Snow Queen went away, but she took a shard of ice and threw it at the old woman, so that it cut her right in the eye. So the old woman’s eye became dim and she could hardly see, and when the Snow Queen had gone away, she thought her loss was greater than her own, and cried out: ‘Ah, how sad it is that such a beautiful child should be so cruel!’

The next morning, as the little boy, whose name was Kai, came home from school, the old woman met him, and when she saw him she was very sad, and her voice trembled as she said: ‘Ah, Kai, do you not remember me? I am your grandmother. I am very glad to see you, but I am in trouble. I have been sitting here all night with a burning fire, and yet I scarcely see you for the smoke. And yet how beautiful the world looks in winter! How the snow glitters! How the trees and the rooftops shine!’ ‘Grandmother,’ said Kai, ‘how can it look beautiful when you say so? It is only a dirty, drab, grey-brown frost and ice. I like fine weather much better.’

‘Come in, come in,’ said the old woman, ‘and look in the glass, I will show you how the world looks.’ Then she led him to the window, and took him by the hand, and put it into the cold pane, and said: ‘Now look at the world through this.’ And when Kai looked through it, he cried out: ‘Oh, Grandmother, how beautiful the world is! How the sun shines! How the trees and the rooftops sparkle! And there in the distance lies a birch-wood, and behind it stands the most beautiful child I ever saw. Grandmother, let me go out and look at the world.’ ‘Never, never,’ said the old woman. ‘It is the Snow Queen, and she is cruel. She has hurt my eye with a shard of ice.’ ‘But, Grandmother,’ said Kai, ‘she must be very beautiful, for I have never seen anything so beautiful. I must go and see her.’ ‘You will forget me, Kai,’ said the old woman. ‘No,’ said Kai, ‘I will always come back and see you.’

Then he ran away, and the next morning set out on his journey. He walked and walked till he came to the birch-wood, and then he went in, and walked on till he came to the end of it. There the Snow Queen was sitting on her throne, in the very rays of the sun. ‘Greetings, Kai,’ said she. ‘Why have you come?’ ‘Because I saw you through the pane of mica, and thought you were beautiful.’ ‘Then come up here by my side,’ said the Snow Queen. So Kai stepped up on to the spot where she sat, and it was as if he had set his foot upon marble, for it was as hard as rock. ‘Do you see the world down there?’ said the Snow Queen. ‘Yes,’ answered Kai. ‘How small and insignificant everything looks!’ ‘Yes,’ said the Snow Queen, ‘and you, too, are quite insignificant, and have no understanding at all.’ Then she took a dart of ice and threw it in his heart. It is said that this dart pierced him through and through, and that he felt no pain, but only that everything was frozen, so that his heart became hard as ice.

Then the Snow Queen rose up and went away, and took Kai with her. She flew over the sea, and Kai did not die, but sat in her lap, and was changed into a living snow-man. His hair became like white wool, and his eyes were like two pieces of coal, but his heart remained hard as ice.

The news of Kai’s departure reached the old woman, and she wept and tore her hair, and cried: ‘O Heaven, what shall I do?’ Then her sister, who lived in the next village, came to see her, and said: ‘Why do you weep, sister? What is the matter?’ ‘Ah,’ answered the old woman, ‘my grandson Kai has been taken away by the Snow Queen.’ ‘What!’ said the sister. ‘Ought not I to go and help you?’ ‘Yes, indeed,’ answered the old woman. ‘Take my sledge, and my whip, and my clothes, for I see no hope of his return.’

Then the sister harnessed herself to the sledge, and the old woman gave her a lump of coal for the cold, and said: ‘Take care of yourself, I am afraid of the Snow Queen.’ So off she went, over the fields, over the marshes, over the heath, over the mountains, till she came to the sea. There stood a shipman by the shore, and she asked him if he would row her over to the Sea-King’s palace, which lay on an island in the middle of the sea. ‘For how much will you do it?’ asked the sister. ‘For your clothes,’ answered the shipman. ‘Very well,’ said she; ‘but promise to row me back again after I have found Kai.’ Then she took off her clothes and gave them to the shipman, and jumped into the boat, and he rowed her over to the island.

There was a great hall in the Sea-King’s palace, and around it were seven rows of seats, filled with all sorts of fish. ‘Pray, whose are these seats?’ asked the sister. ‘The first are for the greatest fishes in the sea,’ said the Sea-King. ‘And the next for the next greatest?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘And the next for the next?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘And the next for the next?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘And the smallest for the smallest?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘And where do you sit?’ ‘I sit on the throne.’ ‘And where does the Snow Queen sit?’ ‘In the rays of the sun.’

Then the sister asked if he knew where Kai was. ‘I do,’ said he; ‘he is with the Snow Queen, and she sits in the rays of the sun.’ ‘Have you seen a sister of mine?’ asked the sister. ‘Yes,’ answered the Sea-King, ‘she is sitting in the first row, next to the biggest fish in the sea.’ ‘Then will you let me have a boat and some oars?’ said the sister. ‘Yes,’ answered the Sea-King; ‘but promise to return by ten o’clock, or the tide will catch you.’

So the sister rowed to the shore, and went on through the birch-wood, till she came to the Snow Queen’s palace. The doors stood wide open, and she saw Kai sitting inside, and he was like a living snow-man. His hair had become like white wool, and his eyes like two pieces of coal, but his heart was hard as ice. Then she took the lump of coal and threw it at him, and cried:"

","There was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter. And this miller was so
overjoyed at the thought of her, that he thought of nothing else day or night,
but how she should be well married and provided for. So he went one day to
the king, and begged that he would give him a husband for his daughter. ‘Yes,’
said the king, ‘if the youth be rich, and in high favour with me, I will give
him to her.’ Then the miller promised that he would soon find some one who
would suit him.

The miller went out of the king’s presence, and by the side of a river saw
seven little frogs sitting together. ‘What are you doing here?’ asked the
miller. ‘We are all sisters and brothers,’ said the frogs, ‘and have lost our
father, and do not know where our mother is; we have run away from home, and
are roaming about the world, and do not know where to go. Our father was a
king, and ruled over a wide country; but our brother, who was next in blood
to the throne, was very wicked, and wanted to kill us all, for we were much
younger than he was, and could not defend ourselves. Our father, however,
took us and ran away; but he was overtaken, and killed by a huntsman, and we
are now very unhappy, and do not know where to go.’

‘How do you contrive to live?’ asked the miller. ‘We find a pond or stream
where there is any water, and beg a few penn’orth of cracknels or bread, and
then we live upon them. But who are you?’

‘I am a poor miller, and want to marry my daughter to a king; if you will
be so, and be rich, I will ask the king to give you the kingdom which your
father ruled.’ The frogs were overjoyed at the thought, and said, ‘Yes, yes,
do so, and we will do all you wish.’

Then the miller went back to the king, and said, ‘There is a king’s son who
will marry my daughter, and he is very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,
rich, and in high favour with you.’ The king made haste to say yes to this,
and ordered the wedding to be got ready.

The day soon came when the wedding was to be celebrated. The miller and his
daughter were overjoyed, and the seven little frogs were brought in by the
miller. ‘Do as I bid you,’ said he, ‘and you shall be well rewarded.’ Then he
bade one of them sit on the king’s head, another on the queen’s head, the
third on the marshal’s head, the fourth on the chamberlain’s head, the fifth
on the butler’s head, the sixth on the cook’s head, and the seventh on the
waiter’s head.

So they were seated, and the king and all his court sat down to the wedding
feast. When the time came for eating, the king wanted to take some food, but
the frog on his head cried out, ‘Stop! Stop!’ The king was frightened, and
did not eat. Then the frog said, ‘I am hungry, give me some food.’ So someone
gave the frog a roll, and it ate it all up. After that the king tried to eat,
but the frog cried out, ‘Stop! Stop!’ Again he was told to wait till the frog
had eaten. So it ate another roll, and then the king was allowed to eat.

When the king had finished his dinner, and was merry, the frog on his head
said, ‘I am tired, I want to go to bed.’ Then all the court went to their
seats and beds, but the king and queen went to their bed-chamber. The frog
on the queen’s head, however, cried out, ‘Stop! Stop!’ and did not let them
go in. ‘Why do you cry out?’ said the king. ‘I am tired, and want to sleep,
so let the bed be carried out here,’ said the frog. Then the bed was carried
out, and the king and queen were forced to lie down on it in the antechamber.
The frog on the queen’s bed again cried out, ‘I am hungry, give me something
to eat.’ So they gave it a roll, and it ate it up. After that the king and
queen were allowed to go to bed.

In the morning, before the king and all his court had got up, the frogs jumped
down from their heads, and jumped into a pool close by, and all became kings

","The Shepherd and the Star

In a land far away, there lived a poor shepherd who had only one sheep, and one old dog that was as poor as he. They lived in a little hut upon the side of a hill, and in the daytime the shepherd used to take the sheep out upon the heath, and the dog went with him.

One evening, as they were coming home, the sheep found a great stone in its way, and when the shepherd tried to pass it, it laid itself down and would go no farther. Then the shepherd said, ‘What shall I do with you? You have been a true friend to me, and given good service, but now you are grown old and weak, and this stone is too heavy for you. What can I do but kill you?’ So he took his staff and struck the poor animal, and it fell to the ground dead.

Then the old dog came up and licked the blood that flowed from the sheep, and said, ‘Alas! alas! my master will have nothing to live upon, if he kills me next. I will go into the world and try what I can do to help him.’

So away went the dog, over the hills and far away, till he came to a village. Now in this village there was a butcher, who was famous all around for the good roasts that he made, and the great fires that he burnt before his house. So the dog went up to the butcher’s house, and said, ‘All the world knows how good your roasts are, but your fires are what everybody marvels at; they burn with such a little wood, and yet how large they are! Tell me, I pray, how you manage it.’

‘How can that be of any use to me?’ said the butcher; ‘come in, and let’s talk of something worth while.’

Then he brought the dog in, and gave him plenty to eat and drink, and let him lie by the fire; and when he had told his tale, the butcher said, ‘I will tell you what--you are a clever dog, and I like you, so I will teach you how to get me all the wood that you can find, and in return I will give you as much meat as you can eat.’

So the dog went into the woods, and every morning came back loaded with wood, and the butcher gave him as much meat as he could eat. But one morning, as he was going away, he said to the butcher, ‘I have served you long enough; now tell me what it is all about, that you make such a great fire, and yet use so little wood.’

Then the butcher said, ‘I am a witch, and I make my fires with wind, not with wood. I have been trying to find out if you were worthy to be my familiar, and now at last I am going to tell you the truth. You shall go with me to my master, the king of the witches, and you shall be well rewarded.’

So he took the dog with him, and they journeyed on and on, till at last they came to a great castle, where all the lights were out, and yet it looked as if a thousand people lived there. Then the butcher knocked at the door, and when he had spoken to someone within, the door was thrown open, and they went in.

Everything was so grand that the dog could not help standing on his legs, and looking about him; and the butcher said, ‘You have been a faithful servant, and I will reward you as you deserve. Here is a cloak that will make you invisible, and here is a hat that will make you any size you wish to be. Now go into the kitchen, and ask for some broth; then, when they are going to throw it out, tell them you want it for a very poor old man who is at the gate, and who will give you something in return.’

Then the dog put on the cloak, so that he became invisible, and went into the kitchen, and said what the butcher told him. And the cook was just going to throw out some broth that was not good enough for the witches to eat, and she gave it to him.

But as he was going out, the butler saw him, and said, ‘What are you about, stealing our broth?’ Then the dog said, ‘I am taking it to a very poor old man who is at the gate, and will give me something in return.’

‘Give it him,’ said the butler; ‘he talks sensibly.’

So the dog took the broth, and went with it to the butcher, who took it away, and put into it a sleeping draught, so that when the witches came to drink it they should fall asleep.

Then the butcher gave the dog the hat, and said, ‘Put that on, and take such a large size as will enable you to reach the highest shelf.’

So he put on the hat, and grew big and tall, and went into the kitchen, and took the sleeping draught that was in the broth, and brought it to the butcher.

And when the butcher had put on the cloak, and was invisible, he went with the dog into the kitchen, and the butcher cried out, ‘Why do you sleep there?’ and he shook all the witches, so that they awoke and were very angry.

Then the butcher said, ‘What are you doing here?’

‘We are having a feast,’ said they.

‘What are you feasting on?’ said the butcher.

‘On a nice fat dog that I got in the village,’ said one.

‘And I had a beautiful young lamb,’ said another.

‘And I had a fine young calf,’ said a third.

‘You wicked witches!’ said the butcher; ‘you have been eating my familiar, and my two friends who went with him! I thought I should have had a good feast myself, if you had left them to me. Now, as you have eaten them, you shall die in your turn.’

Then he called his servant, the butler, and said, ‘Stretch yonder rope across the room.’

So the butler stretched the rope across the room.

‘And now,’ said the butcher, ‘you witches must dance for me, and whenever I tell you, jump over the rope.’

So they began to dance, and the butcher clapped his hands, and cried, ‘Jump!’ Then they jumped, and stuck their heads and feet fast in the rope, and danced in the air, with their bodies between, till they died.

And the butcher and the dog returned home safe and happy, and the butcher said, ‘As you have served me well, and as you are so clever, I will let you choose whatever you will. Either I will give you a beautiful golden cage, with a golden chain, and you shall be my familiar, and live upon meat, and have plenty to eat and drink; or, if you would rather, I will restore your old master to life, and to everything he had in the world before.’

Then the dog thought a little, and said, ‘I will take my master back to life.’

So the butcher brought him to the hill where the shepherd lived, and gave him his flock of sheep, and his old dog, and all that he had before his poor animal was killed; and there they all lived happily to the end.

","The Bremen Town Musicians

In a village lived a dog, a cat, a donkey, and a cock. They had long been old and had no longer been able to work, so they had to provide for themselves out of their own pockets. One day they agreed that they would go into the world and try to earn a living as musicians.

So they set out together, and when they had walked for some time they came to a town. ‘We shall not go straight into the town,’ said the donkey, ‘but will rest here for a while under this bush until we have gathered some strength.’ So they lay down and went to sleep. It was not long before a parson passed by, and seeing four beasts lying there, he said: ‘What a fine sight! Four beasts lying asleep together!’ He called his servant and made him go up to them and see if it was true. The servant approached, and as the beasts showed themselves to be very shy, they thought it would be the best thing to do, and pretended to be asleep. The servant went away and told the parson that it was true, and that they were lying fast asleep. ‘If that is so,’ said the parson, ‘they must be witches who have taken the form of beasts, and have come together for some wicked purpose. We must follow them at once and catch them while they are sleeping.’ The parson was much excited, and took his servant with him and hurried to the town hall and told the mayor and aldermen what had happened, and that four witches were lying fast asleep under the bush, and that it was essential that they should be caught and burnt. The mayor and aldermen were terrified at the thought, and told the parson that he and his servant should wait there until daybreak, and that they themselves would go with a strong body of men and catch the witches while they were asleep.

The night was not long in passing, and the four musicians awoke and said: ‘It is time for us to go, for it is not safe here.’ But when they got upon their legs they felt very weak, and could hardly support themselves. ‘We must rest for a short time,’ said the donkey, ‘until our strength comes back.’ So they lay down again, and soon fell asleep. It was not long before a doctor passed by, and seeing four beasts lying there, he said: ‘What a fine sight! Four beasts lying asleep together!’ He called his servant and made him go up and see if it was true. The servant went and found them fast asleep, and as they did not stir when he approached, he went away and told the doctor that it was true, and that they were lying fast asleep. ‘If that is so,’ said the doctor, ‘they must be poisoned, and have taken the form of beasts, and have come together for the purpose of killing themselves. We must follow them at once and catch them while they are sleeping.’ The doctor was much excited, and took his servant with him and hurried to the town hall and told the mayor and aldermen what had happened, and that four rogues were lying fast asleep under the bush, and that it was essential that they should be caught and hanged. The mayor and aldermen were terrified at the thought, and told the doctor that he and his servant should wait there until daybreak, and that they themselves would go with a strong body of men and catch the rogues while they were sleeping.

The night was not long in passing, and the four musicians awoke and said: ‘It is time for us to go, for it is not safe here.’ But when they got upon their legs they felt very weak, and could hardly support themselves. ‘We must rest for a short time,’ said the donkey, ‘until our strength comes back.’ So they lay down again, and soon fell asleep. It was not long before a soldier passed by, and seeing four beasts lying there, he said: ‘What a fine sight! Four beasts lying asleep together!’ He called his comrade and made him go up and see if it was true. The comrade went and found them fast asleep, and as they did not stir when he approached, he went away and told the soldier that it was true, and that they were lying fast asleep. ‘If that is so,’ said the soldier, ‘they must be thieves who have taken the form of beasts, and have come together for some wicked purpose. We must follow them at once and catch them while they are sleeping.’ The soldier was much excited, and took his comrade with him and hurried to the town hall and told the mayor and aldermen what had happened, and that four thieves were lying fast asleep under the bush, and that it was essential that they should be caught and transported. The mayor and aldermen were terrified at the thought, and told the soldier that he and his comrade should wait there until daybreak, and that they themselves would go with a strong body of soldiers and catch the thieves while they were sleeping.

The night was not long in passing, and the four musicians awoke and said: ‘It is time for us to go, for it is not safe here.’ But when they got upon their legs they felt very weak, and could hardly support themselves. ‘We must rest for a short time,’ said the donkey, ‘until our strength comes back.’ So they lay down again, and soon fell asleep. It was not long before a hunt passed by, and seeing four beasts lying there, the huntsman said: ‘What a fine sight! Four beasts lying asleep together!’ He called his servant and made him go up and see if it was true. The servant went and found them fast asleep, and as they did not stir when he approached, he went away and told the huntsman that it was true, and that they were lying fast asleep. ‘If that is so,’ said the huntsman, ‘they must be deer who have taken the form of beasts, and have come together for some wicked purpose. We must follow them at once and catch them while they are sleeping.’ The huntsman was much excited, and took his servant with him and hurried to the town hall and told the mayor and aldermen what had happened, and that four deer were lying fast asleep under the bush, and that it was essential that they should be caught and killed. The mayor and aldermen were terrified at the thought, and told the huntsman that he and his servant should wait there until daybreak, and that they themselves would go with a strong body of huntsmen and catch the deer while they were sleeping.

But when the day dawned, and the four musicians saw that they had been lucky and had been mistaken for so many things, they said: ‘It is time for us to go into the town and try our luck.’ So they went into the town and placed themselves in front of the gates of the houses and began to play a merry tune. Many people came together and made a crowd, and when they saw four beasts playing music they did not know what to think, and called the mayor and aldermen to come and see the wonder. The mayor and aldermen came and watched them from a distance, and as they were old men they felt no fear, and at last went up to them and asked them what they wanted. ‘We want to live here,’ said the dog, ‘and if you please we will give you some music every day.’ ‘You may live here quite peaceably,’ said the mayor and aldermen, ‘and we will only ask one thing of you, that you shall not play your music too early in the morning.’ ‘That we will not do,’ said the dog. ‘We will wait until it is six o’clock.’ ‘Seven o’clock,’ said the cat. ‘Seven o’clock is still too early,’ said the donkey. ‘We will leave it to eight o’clock.’ ‘That will still be early,’ said the cock. ‘We will wait until nine o’clock.’ ‘That will be all right,’ said the others. ‘We will wait until nine o’clock.’ So the musicians were allowed to live in peace, and every day at nine o’clock they went to the town gates and played a merry tune.

","There was once a poor old woman who had only one cow, and this cow gave her but little milk. So she was often obliged to go out in the evening to look for food for herself and her child. Now now it so happened that one evening she could find nothing to get, and was very much frightened, for she could not reach home in safety, and the night was dark and stormy. At length she saw a light in a cave, and went up to it, and found a little dwarf sitting there. ‘Do give me something to eat,’ said she, ‘or I shall starve.’ ‘What will you give me in return?’ asked the dwarf. ‘My beautiful cow,’ answered the woman. ‘No,’ said the dwarf, ‘I will not take your cow, for she is not very fat; but I will give you a calf that will always be fat, and will give you a quart of milk every morning.’ So the old woman was very glad, and said she would do what he wished; and the dwarf gave her a calf, and went his way.

The old woman took the calf home, and it always gave a great deal of milk; for the dwarf had kept his word, and every morning there was a quart for the woman. And she thought to herself, ‘If this is the case, what will not the little creature be when it is grown up?’ So she made up her mind to kill it, and take the flesh to the next town to sell, and there she might be able to buy some good clothes with the money. But the calf knew what she was going to do, and one morning when she went to milk it, it gave her a kick with its hind legs, and ran away. Then she was very angry, and cried out, ‘You ungrateful creature, you shall repent this as long as you live!’

She could not run after the calf, for it was very quick, and soon outstripped her; but she still kept on crying out her curse. At length the calf saw a man approaching, and thought to itself, ‘If I take up any food now, and eat it, my mistress will know where I am, and will run and take my life.’ So it did not dare to eat, but went on as fast as it could. And when it had gone about half a mile, it saw a baker sitting by the roadside with some bread. ‘Do give me a loaf,’ cried the calf, ‘or I shall starve.’ ‘Who are you, and what are you doing here?’ said the baker. ‘I am a poor traveller, and have nothing to eat.’ ‘What a big appetite you have!’ said the baker, ‘you must be very strong.’ ‘Yes,’ answered the calf, ‘I am very strong.’ Then the baker said, ‘I will just see you into the next town.’ So he put the calf on his cart, and drove it on, and it ate up the bread that the baker had given it, and was still hungry.

When they came to the town, the baker said, ‘I cannot take you with me, for it is not seemly to drag a calf about the streets; so if you will give me the best of your flesh when I kill you, I will keep you.’ But the calf said, ‘No, I will not do that.’ Then the baker said, ‘I will give you to the butcher.’ And the butcher took the calf, and thought to himself, ‘If I take it to the fair that is soon to be held, and it gets fat on the way, I shall be able to sell it for a great sum of money.’

So he drove it away, and every day it ate more and more, and grew bigger and bigger; till at last it was so large that the butcher could not drive it any farther, and said, ‘I cannot take it to the fair now, for it would push down all the other cattle; so I had better kill it.’

Then the butcher went up to it, and was going to have driven the stake into its heart, when it said, ‘Wait a little, I am not quite ready to die.’ In another minute it said again, ‘Now I am ready.’ Then the butcher drove the stake into its heart, and as soon as it was dead it became quite small, and the butcher carried it home on his shoulder, and cut it up, and sold all that was best to the king’s table.

When the old woman heard that such a fine animal had been found, and that it had been sold to the butcher, and that the butcher had sold part of it to the king, she was very much frightened, and said, ‘They will soon find out who it was, and then they will kill me.’ So she went to the butcher, and said, ‘Do pray give me some of the flesh of the calf, for I am very fond of it.’ ‘Certainly,’ said the butcher, ‘I will give you as much as you can carry.’ Then he gave her a great piece, which she put on her shoulder, and took home with her.

But when she got home, and was going to eat it, she said to herself, ‘I will just make up my mind to take care of myself, in case my wickedness should be discovered.’ Then she set the piece of meat aside for the present, and sat down and combed her grey hair, and when she had done she said, ‘Now I will eat, and enjoy myself, for tomorrow I shall be sorry.’ So she took the meat, and ate it all up.

The next morning, as she was going out to look for food, the policeman met her, and said, ‘You old sinner, you have killed your own child, for the flesh of that calf was its flesh, which you have just eaten.’ Then the old woman fell on her knees, and cried out, ‘Ah, heavens! what shall I do?’ But the policeman took her to the magistrate, and she was sentenced to be hanged.

When the day came that she was to die, she was led up to the gallows, and all the people came out to see her. Then she was bound to the gallows, and the rope put round her neck, and the ladder taken away. But when they were going to let her fall, she said, ‘I will tell you a tale.’ ‘No,’ said the constable, ‘not now, not now.’ ‘Oh, do let her tell her tale,’ cried the people; ‘we will hear what it is, and then she may have it for her last saying.’

So the old woman began to tell her tale, and said, ‘There was once a king’s son who went out hunting, and did not come back, and nobody knew where he was, or what had happened to him.’ ‘Now will you be quiet,’ said the constable; ‘it is of no use to tell your tale, you must die.’

But the old woman still continued, ‘The king sent out people to seek for his son, and they went a great way, till they came to a cave, where a dwarf lived. The dwarf knew at once what had become of the prince, and said he must have followed him into the cave. Then the king sent one of his men into the cave to try if he could find the prince, but he had not gone far before he heard a noise like the noise of a wheel, and the dwarf came up to him, and said, “That is the mill that will turn your prince’s flesh into blood, and then he will be quite dead.” So the man came back, and told the king what had happened, and said, “The dwarf told me that if I would bring him a piece of beef, as big as my head, he would give me the mill, and then I should be able to turn the prince’s flesh into blood.”

Then the king sent the interpreter to the dwarf, to try and find out what the price of the mill was. And the dwarf said, “I will tell you what I will do; I will give you the mill for the flesh of a man.” But the interpreter said, “Not for all the world would"

","There was once a poor woodman who cut wood in the forest, and lived there with his wife. One day he cut too much wood and was very tired, so he sat down and took a nap. While he slept, a little dwarf came and took away all the wood from his cart, and when the woodman awoke and saw that all his work was undone, he was very angry, and called out: ‘Who has been stealing my wood?’ But no one answered, and he saw no one, so he thought it must have been the fairies.

Then he gathered up all the wood and took it home to his wife, and said, ‘I will watch and see who takes my wood, for I am sure it is the fairies.’ So next day, when it was getting dark, he piled up a great deal of wood, and sat himself down behind a tree near by, that he might see who took it.

His wife, too, was curious to see the fairies, and peeped out of the hole in the door while he was away. And as she saw the woodman sitting behind the tree, she ran and hid herself.

Now the fairies soon came. They flew through the air in a merry dance, singing:

 ‘Round and round the wood we go,
  Where the trees in the greenwood grow;
  Little dwarfs are we,
  Merry are we!
  Heigho! heigho!
  Reel and skip,
  And tap your shoes upon my lip.’

And they came to the place where the wood lay, and each took a piece, and sat down upon a stump to smoke his pipe, and enjoy himself. But the woodman was so frightened when he saw them that he ran and hid himself; and when he heard the merry music and laughing, he thought it was a very happy party, and envied them.

Presently they began to gather up their things and go home; and the one who had taken the most wood put all he had in his pocket, and took it away with him. But the woodman, who had been watching him, ran up to him, and took him prisoner, and carried him off to his house, and said, ‘Now, you must work hard for me, and do all the job I tell you to do, or you will have a bad time of it.’ Then he took him to his wife, and said, ‘Look, I have got one of them at last, and he must do all the work for us now.’

The little dwarf was at first very unwilling, and said, ‘How can a poor little fellow like me do all the work?’ But the woodman and his wife were very powerful, and they said, ‘Yes, you must do it.’ So at last he said, ‘Well, I’ll try.’

Then they took him into the forest, and showed him a great tree which they said was full of gold, but that the door was too high for them to reach, and that they had worked hard for three years to get to it, but could not. Then the little dwarf soon set to work, and in a very short time he had cut down the tree, and brought all the gold to the woodman and his wife.

After this, the little dwarf did all the work for them; he dug their garden, kept it clean, and did all the housework, besides working in the forest. And they were very kind to him, and let him have all the food he could eat, and as much to drink as he could want; and every three months he had to go into the mountain and brought home more gold.

But one day the wife said to him, ‘Why do you work so hard for those two silly people? You ought to be sorry for a little dwarf like you to be a servant to two louts like that.’ Then the little dwarf said, ‘How can I help it? They are my masters.’

However, when she saw him so unhappy, she said, ‘I will help you.’ So she called the woodman, and said, ‘Listen, you silly fellow, why do you keep the little dwarf as a servant? He is much cleverer than you are, and he ought to be free. I say he shall be free.’

Then the woodman was very angry, and said, ‘We will see about that.’ So he made a seat on a high tree, and told the dwarf that the fairies were going to sit in judgment upon him, and that he must appear before them. The little dwarf was afraid, and went, but when he got up to the seat the woodman cut the ladder, so that he had to fall from the tree.

When he found that he was not hurt, he was very angry, and said, ‘You have cheated me, and I will cheat you.’ Then he went to a baker and bought a loaf of bread, and cut it into two pieces as big as his head, and went to the woodman and threw one of them down at his feet, and said, ‘Here is a stone.’

The woodman stooped down to pick it up, but the bread was very soft, and the weight was so great that he could not lift it, and he fell on his knees. Then the little dwarf threw down the other piece of bread near his wife, and she fell on her knees and prayed to the fairies to deliver her, for she saw that the little dwarf would take his revenge.

But the little dwarf said, ‘You shall work for me now.’ And then he went home to his own people, and told them how he had been treated, and they were very angry, and went to the woodman and his wife, and took them away, and set the woodman and his wife to work, one grinding and the other spinning, without any rest day or night.

And thus the little dwarf got his revenge, and the woodman and his wife worked till they died, for there is no saying how long fairy magic can last.

","The Shepherd Boy and the Wolf

In a village in the Black Forest lived a shepherd boy whose father had
died, and who supported his mother by the scanty earnings he got by
tending the village sheep. One day he took his flock to feed upon the
mountain side, and as he was sitting down to rest, he heard a wolf close
by, making a most dismal howling. He was not at all afraid, but called
out, ‘Do what you will with the sheep, only don’t eat me!’ The wolf came
towards him, and said, ‘I only want to talk with you.’ ‘Very well,’ said
the boy, ‘but if you want to eat me, begin and eat, for there is no
stopping you.’ ‘No,’ said the wolf, ‘I only want to ask you a few
questions. How many sheep have you there?’ ‘How many?’ said the boy, ‘I
have not counted them, but I will tell you what I will do: I will take
you round them, and whatever I say to you, that will be the number. As
you care nothing about eating me, I will tell you the truth. When I say,
‘That is one,’ that means there is one, when I say, ‘That is two,’ that
means there are two, and so on. Now then, come and listen.’ Then he
began to count them, and every time he said any thing the wolf wrote
it down. ‘That is one,’ said the boy, and the wolf wrote down ‘1.’ ‘That
is two,’ said the boy, and the wolf wrote down ‘2.’ ‘That is three,’ said
the boy, and the wolf wrote down ‘3.’ ‘That is four,’ said the boy, and
the wolf wrote down ‘4.’ ‘That is five,’ said the boy, and the wolf wrote
down ‘5.’ ‘That is six,’ said the boy, and the wolf wrote down ‘6.’ ‘That
is seven,’ said the boy, and the wolf wrote down ‘7.’ ‘That is eight,’
said the boy, and the wolf wrote down ‘8.’ ‘That is nine,’ said the boy,
and the wolf wrote down ‘9.’ ‘That is ten,’ said the boy, and the wolf
wrote down ‘10.’ ‘Now, then, how many sheep have you?’ said the wolf.
‘Twenty-one,’ answered the boy. ‘Now,’ said the wolf, ‘lie down there
behind that great stone, and don’t move a finger, and pretend to be
asleep.’ ‘But what are you going to do?’ said the boy. ‘Why, I am going
to make the best of you, that’s all.’ So the wolf went away, and the boy
hid himself behind the stone as he was told. Soon after came a dog, and
then a fox, and then a bear, one after the other, each wanting to share
the sheep with the wolf. ‘It is not fair,’ said the fox, ‘that the wolf
should have them all to himself.’ ‘If you will help me to watch and I
will share them with you,’ said the boy. ‘Very well,’ said the fox, ‘but
you must promise not to call out.’ So they laid themselves down to
watch, but the boy, as soon as it was midnight, cried out at the top of
his voice, ‘Three hundred and sixty-five! Three hundred and sixty-six!
Three hundred and sixty-seven!’ and so on, till he had counted all the
sheep. The wolf was so frightened that he sprang up and ran away as fast
as he could, and the dog, fox, and bear, having got what they could,
scampered away after him. The shepherd boy then came out from behind the
stone, and gathered together his flock, which had run away in the chase,
and went home safely. ‘The End.’"

","The Shepherd’s Boy and the Wolf

In a village lived a poor shepherd, who had only one ewe-lamb very much
beloved by him. One day he took the little sheep with him into the forest
to feed, and then went himself home to dinner. The lamb ran about in the
wood, eating here and there, and at last came to a little stream. ‘How
pretty it is here!’ cried the lamb, ‘how cool and clear the water is! I
would so like to take a drink.’ So saying, it leapt down into the stream.
When the shepherd boy came back, his sheep was nowhere to be seen; so he
called and searched, but all in vain. Then he was very sad, and knew not
what to do, when a wolf came by, and said to him, ‘What’s the matter? Why
are you so sad?’ ‘Alas!’ said the shepherd, ‘my little lamb has run away,
and I don’t know where to find it.’ ‘If that be the case,’ said the wolf,
‘I will find it for you, but promise me that you will do what I wish you
to do.’ ‘Anything, anything,’ answered the shepherd, ‘only bring me my
lamb.’ ‘Then listen,’ said the wolf; ‘when you come to a house where a
roast goat is turning on the spit, and two little girls are at the door,
one of them named Hans, and the other Hansel, do not stop with them,
but go on with me.’

The shepherd boy thought to himself: ‘The wolf wants to devour my poor
lamb, and then eat me likewise.’ However, he said: ‘I will do it.’ So the
wolf led him through the forest to the house where the little lamb was.
The shepherd was overjoyed when he saw it was safe, but the wolf cried
out: ‘Stop, stop! This way goes the water, turn back or you will perish.’
Then the shepherd boy was forced to promise that, whenever they should
come to a large tree with a hollow trunk, he would take away the little
lamb, and let the wolf have it. The wolf, however, had no intention of
keeping even this promise, but would have run straight to the shepherd’s
house and devoured his wife and children, if the shepherd had not been
forced to run away by the people who were seeking him on account of the
lamb.

The wolf did not wait until the shepherd was gone, but ate up the poor
little lamb, and then laid himself down and waited for the shepherd. When
he came, the wolf said: ‘You wicked boy! Have you forgotten me? Have you
forgotten the promise you made to me? Give me the lamb.’ ‘Ah!’ answered
the shepherd, ‘you are a villain! You have devoured my lamb, and now you
want to eat me too.’ ‘Listen,’ said the wolf, ‘when you come to a marsh
full of water and flowers, and a little child is standing in it, and
crying, and you see a breadcrumb lying on the ground, and another child
standing on each side of it, one of the names of whom is Hans, and the
other Hansel, let the little one go, and take the other; I will eat the
first, but will spare the second.’ The shepherd thought: ‘The wolf will
certainly soon have a roast shepherd, if I do not get away from him.’ So
he ran to the police and gave the wolf in the bargain.

The wolf, however, did not leave the matter thus, but went to the father
and mother of the two children, and cried out: ‘I am a wolf, and have
carried off your children into the forest, but this shepherd boy is coming
after me, and will kill me; if, therefore, you love your children, you
must help me.’ ‘Oh, wolf,’ said the father, ‘why have you done such a
wicked thing? We will do everything you wish.’ Then the wolf said: ‘Listen,
I am at present eating little Hans, and if you do not throw down to me, as
quick as you can, two pounds of breadcrumbs and a pound of meat, I will
stop eating and let the child go.’ The father ran to the baker and made
him bring the bread, and the butcher the meat, and then he threw it all
into the forest. The wolf did not stop there, but cried out: ‘This is not
enough, unless you bring me, as quickly as you can, six pounds of bread
and three pounds of meat.’ The father ran to the baker and the butcher
again, and they brought the bread and meat. When the wolf had satisfied
his appetite, and had made a roast of both the children, he stretched
their bodies out, and laid themselves down on each side of the path, and
then went to sleep.

Early in the morning, when the father was coming to feed his little flock
of sheep, he saw the two children, and almost fainted with fear and
grief, and then he awakened their mother. She wept and lamented, and when
they had looked at the children and seen that they were dead, they
sorrowed and bewailed them for three days. Then they buried them, and
their grief was more than they could bear. ‘Alas!’ said the mother,
‘what shall we do now? We will wander from place to place, that we may
forget our sorrow.’ ‘Yes,’ said the father, ‘that is a good thought.
Let us go into a strange country, and there we may perhaps hear of some
place where we can earn our livelihood.’

So they took their little flock of sheep with them, and walked day and
night without stopping, always following different paths. At last they
came to a great forest, and as they were very tired, they thought they
would rest for a while. The shepherd built a little hut, and the woman
gathered together twigs and heath, and made a fire, and they sat down
close by it, and watched their sheep. ‘I do not like living here,’ said
the mother, ‘how lonely and dreary it is.’ ‘I am quite satisfied,’ said the
father, ‘and here we can at any rate take care of ourselves.’

One day, as the woman sat by the fire, she looked through the forest,
and saw two little children coming towards her. ‘Ah!’ she cried, ‘how
delightful! To see children again! They are so like Hans and Hansel.’
As they came nearer, she went out and gave them some food, and asked if
they belonged to any one, and where they came from. ‘Oh, yes,’ said they,
‘we belong to no one, and we come from the other side of the forest.’
Then the woman said: ‘You must be weary,’ and she made up a bed for them
by the fire, and next morning she gave them something to eat, and they
went out to feed the sheep with the two children.

In the evening when they came back, a man was sitting by the fire. ‘Where
have you been?’ said the mother. ‘In the forest looking for food, and
finding none,’ answered the children. ‘Ah!’ said the woman, ‘it is a
waste of time looking for food here, we must soon think of something else
to do.’ ‘I am quite satisfied,’ said the man, ‘and here we can at any rate
take care of ourselves.’

The two children, Hans and Hansel, always went out with the shepherd and
his wife when they took their sheep into the forest, and gathered up the
heath and fuel together. Once when they were thus employed, they saw a"

","The Enchanted Fiddle

There was once upon a time a poor peasant named Hans, who worked hard all
day long, and yet could not earn enough to support himself and his wife.
‘How can we manage to live?’ said he. ‘What will my poor wife get to eat?’
‘I’ll tell you what, Hans,’ said she, ‘you must try and get a job in
town, then we shall have something to live upon.’ So Hans left his little
cottage, and went into the town, where he soon found a place as waiter in
a public-house. He worked hard, but his wages were small, and at the end
of a month he had not earned half enough to take home to his wife.

‘What shall I do?’ said he. ‘How can I get anything to take home to my
wife?’ So he went into the back kitchen, and took an old fiddle that
hung on the wall, and began to knock it together as well as he could.

Now the landlord of the house had an enchanted fiddle, which could be
played by anyone, but when it was played by a true artist, it played of
its own accord. When therefore he heard the waiter in the back kitchen
knocking away at the old fiddle, he went in and said, ‘Hark you, Hans,
that fiddle is not yours, and if you play it, it will play of its own
accord, and then you will have some trouble. If you can play it, I will
give it you, but if it plays of its own accord, you must go away and never
come back.’

Hans said, ‘I will soon try.’

Then he took the fiddle and went into a corner, and the fiddle began to
play of its own accord, and danced upon the strings the most wonderful
things, so that Hans had to laugh and clap his hands. ‘Ah!’ said the
landlord, ‘you must go away, you cannot stay here.’

But Hans begged so hard that the landlord let him have the fiddle, and
said, ‘Take it, and if you can play it, it will play of its own accord,
but if it plays of itself, away you must go.’

Hans took the fiddle to his lodgings, and when he had eaten his supper,
he took it out and tried what he could do. He had been a waiter in the
town, it is true, but he had been a soldier before, and had often played
the fiddle then, so he soon made the best of it, and played a merry tune
on it.

Now as he was in the middle of a reel, the fiddle stopped, and said,

 ‘Humans are such silly things!
  How can they play me, and not understand my song?’

Hans was so astonished that he fell off his chair.

‘Now,’ said the fiddle, ‘I’ll tell you a tale. There was once upon a time
a king who had twelve beautiful daughters, and as they were all very
beautiful, and had the most charming manners, and were kind and good
to everybody, the king thought he would have a great feast given, and
would give each of his daughters as a prize to the best singer, dancer,
and artist of all kinds who should appear at the feast. Now the feast was
held, and singers and dancers came from far and near, but the king and his
daughters stayed below in the hall till some one came who should please
them so much that they could not leave them.

When all were gone, there came in a little dwarf, who bowed down to the
twelve princesses, and said, ‘I am an artist.’ Then he took a box of
pins, and drove a pin into the floor in front of each princess, and
before he had done this they had all twelve pins in the floor, and the
dwarf said, ‘Now I want to play at king and queen with you.’ Then he
began to dance round and round, and the princesses were forced to dance
after him, and whenever he came to any pin they had to stop upon it, and
wait till he came round to it again.

This amused the king and princesses so much that they quite forgot where
they were, and danced on and on, till the time came for the king to give
his twelve beautiful daughters as prizes. But the dwarf said, ‘One more
dance, one more dance!’ Then he made all twelve of them dance together
together, and as they were all joined together, and the dance was so
pretty, that no one could help laughing and clapping their hands.

But the twelfth princess, who was the prettiest of all, slipped away
from the others, and ran behind the scene, and there she found a hollow
tree, and into this she crept, and the huntsmen who were to have taken
her away, took the eleventh instead of her, and the king gave the dwarf,
together with the eleventh princess, as a prize.

When the dance was over, the king looked round for his twelfth princess,
but could not find her, and thought his heart would break, for he loved
her better than all the others. Then the huntsmen said, ‘We will soon
find her, for she has left a white slipper behind her.’ So they looked
about, and found the slipper, and it was quite white, for it was always
kept clean.

The dwarf, too, wanted to have the twelfth princess, and he had two
servants, who were little dwarfs like himself, and they searched the
wood, and found the slipper, and it was quite white still.

Then the fishers went and looked for her by the brook, and found her,
and the slipper was quite white still.

The shepherds looked for her upon the hills, and found her, and the slipper
was quite white still.

The hunters looked for her in the wood, and found her, and the slipper
was quite white still.

The fowlers looked for her in the meadows, and found her, and the slipper
was quite white still.

The schoolmasters looked for her in the schools, and found her, and the
slipper was quite white still.

The sexton looked for her in the church, and found her, and the slipper
was quite white still.

The parson looked for her in the church, and found her, and the slipper
was quite white still.

The squire looked for her in his court, and found her, and the slipper
was quite white still.

The king looked for her in his palace, and found her, and the slipper
was quite white still.

But the twelfth princess, who was the prettiest of all, had run behind
the scene, and there she stayed.

Now the hunt was given up, and the king was very sorrowful, and thought
his heart would break, for he loved the twelfth princess better than all
the others. Then the dwarf said, ‘I can find her, for her slipper is
quite white still.’

‘Do so,’ said the king.

Then the dwarf went his way, and the princess came from behind the
scene, and gave the dwarf’s little servant the slipper that was not quite
white still, and the servant took it to the dwarf.

And the dwarf came back to the king, and said, ‘I have found the princess,
and she is coming with me.’

Then the king was very glad, and thought his heart would burst with
joy, for he thought the twelfth princess was coming.

But it was only the eleventh, who was not half so beautiful as the
twelfth, and was not half"

","Once upon a time, there was a poor peasant named Hans, who had three sons. Now, Hans had no cattle, no sheep, nor any thing else with which he could earn a livelihood, so that he and his wife were very unhappy, and did not know how they should get bread enough to eat. At last they agreed that the eldest son should go out into the wide world and try his luck, and thus earn some money for the family. So he took leave of his father and mother, and set off on his journey.

He walked and walked till at last the road led him through a dark wood. As he was passing through it, it became so dark that he could scarcely see what he was about; and as he was very much afraid, he said, ‘If I but meet a good friend, I shall be happy.’ Not long was he left waiting: for a man soon came in sight, who seemed to be in great trouble, and was tearing his hair and beard, and crying out: ‘Alas! alas! how shall I provide for my poor wife and children? What will become of us?’

‘I feel very sorry for you, my friend,’ said the youth, ‘but I am no rich man myself; yet will I do my best to help you.’

Then he took out what little money he had, and gave it to the man, and said: ‘There, that is all I can give you.’ The other, seeing that the youth had nothing left, would have been well pleased; but he said: ‘No, my friend, you must work harder than that.’ Then he led him to the side of a hill, where some stone was to be quarried, and said: ‘If you will work as a quarryman, and hew stone for me, I will give you food and drink, and pay you what wages I can.’ The youth consented, and began to work; and when the day was ended the man gave him a piece of bread and cheese, and said: ‘That is all I can give you for your work.’

However, the next day the bread and cheese were larger, and the day after they still more so; and so it went on for some days, till the piece of bread was as large as a loaf, and the cheese as big as a wheel. Then the man said to the youth: ‘I can give you no work here any longer; you must go into the town and try to earn a living.’ ‘Where shall I go?’ said the youth. ‘I know not.’ ‘Then look up into the sky, and the first place where the sun rises will be your destination.’

The youth did as he was told, and found that the first place where the sun rose was a town not far off. So he went thither, and as he could find no work in the town, he went out into the country and began to look for some place where he could earn his livelihood.

At last he came to a mill, and as he passed by he saw an old woman sitting behind the door, crying. ‘Why do you weep?’ said he. ‘What is all this?’ ‘Ah, me!’ said the old woman, ‘I am so hungry that I can find nothing to put into my mouth.’ Then the youth offered to work for her, and said: ‘I will work hard, and do what I can to earn my bread.’ ‘That is well,’ said the old woman; ‘then cut down that tree, and make me a windmill.’ The tree was not far off, and the youth cut it down, and made a windmill so nicely that it turned very well. ‘Now,’ said the old woman, ‘you must stand behind the mill and sell the meal.’ As the youth had nothing to live upon, he could not do this, and said: ‘I must have something to eat first.’ Then the old woman gave him a dish of beans, but they were not nearly enough to satisfy him; so he said: ‘I must have more, or I shall die.’ ‘Very well,’ said the old woman; ‘if you can eat two more dishes of beans, you shall have plenty to eat, and as much as you can earn.’

Then the youth sat himself down, and ate one dish of beans after another, till at last he had eaten seven in all; and the old woman kept what he had earned, and said: ‘Now, you shall have a room to sleep in, and plenty to eat.’

So the youth worked hard, and earned a great deal of money; and when he had saved up a hundred talers, he said to the old woman: ‘I must go home to my father and mother, and see them once more; so pray give me my pay.’ But the old woman took no heed of him, and said: ‘Not so fast, not so fast! work on a little longer.’

Then the youth worked on, and earned a hundred talers more; but still the old woman would not give him his pay, and said: ‘You work too quickly; you must wait a little longer.’ However, he worked on, and earned a third hundred talers; and then the old woman said: ‘Now you may have your pay.’

So she gave him a great sack, full of ducats and talers, and said: ‘Take this, and go your way.’ Then the youth took leave of the old woman, and set out on his journey homewards.

As he was travelling along, he came to a wood, and it became so dark that he could not see what he was about, and said: ‘If I but meet a good friend, I shall be happy.’ Not long was he left waiting: for a man soon came in sight, who seemed to be in great trouble, and was tearing his hair and beard, and crying out: ‘Alas! alas! how shall I provide for my poor wife and children? What will become of us?’

Then the youth took out all the money that he had earned, and gave it to the man, and said: ‘There, that is all I can give you.’ The man, seeing that the youth had nothing left, would have been well pleased; but he said: ‘No, my friend, you must work harder than that.’ Then he led him to a great hill, where a mine of gold was, and said: ‘If you will work there, and bring out the gold, I will give you food and drink, and pay you what wages I can.’

So the youth went to work, and laboured hard; and when the day was ended the man gave him a piece of bread and cheese, and said: ‘That is all I can give you for your work.’

The next day the bread and cheese were larger, and the day after they still more so; and so it went on for some days, till the piece of bread was as large as a loaf, and the cheese as big as a wheel. Then the man said to the youth: ‘You must go into the town and try to earn a living.’ ‘Where shall I go?’ said the youth. ‘I know not.’ ‘Then look up into the sky, and the first place where the sun rises will be your destination.’

The youth did as he was told, and found that the first place where the sun rose was the very town where his father lived. ‘The End’"

","There was once a poor woodman, who had nothing to give his wife and
children to eat, but one little piece of bread. So he put it on a dish,
and went into the field to work, leaving his wife at home alone. Now
there was a wolf in the forest, who watched all opportunities of doing
mischief, and had often made himself merry at the expense of the
woodman’s family. As the woman walked backwards and forwards between
the house and the field, carrying the pail of water or the dish of milk,
the wolf, who lay in ambush behind a tree, ran after her, and every time
she reached the house, before she had time to shut the door, he snatched
the dish or pail out of her hand, and ran off with it.

When the woodman came home to his dinner, he found the dish empty, and
saw what had happened. ‘Alas, dear wife!’ said he, ‘what shall we eat
now?’ ‘What can we do, my husband?’ answered she; ‘the wolf has taken
our one piece of bread, and I have nothing to give you but this cup of
water.’ ‘One thing at least we may do,’ said the man; ‘we will work
together, and cut some wood, and I will hew it into handles, and we will
make hoes and spades, and when spring comes we shall be able to earn
something by working in the fields for other people.’ So they agreed
that this was the best way to provide for themselves, and sat down to
consider how they should begin their work. The woman said, ‘I should like
to know if the handles are long or short.’ ‘How can I tell that?’ said
the man; ‘I leave that to you.’ Then the wife said, ‘I should like to
have a hoe, that would reach from the ground to my knee when I am working
with it.’ ‘You shall have it,’ said the man; ‘but I am glad you know so
much about these things.’ Then the wife said, ‘I should like to have a
spade likewise, that would reach from my knee to the ground when I am
working with it.’ ‘You shall have it,’ said the man; ‘you are a true
workwoman.’

The next day the man cut down a tree, and hewed it into two pieces,
one of which was as long as his wife had wished for her hoe, and the
other as long as she had wished for her spade. Then he sharpened one
end of the one, and one end of the other, and brought the tools to his
wife.

The wolf, who had seen what the man and his wife were doing, and knew
that they were making hoes and spades, could not help laughing, and said
to himself, ‘When they begin to work in the fields with these, they will
be sure to tire themselves, and I shall have plenty of opportunities
of making myself merry at their expense.’

Not long after, in the spring, all the fields were full of people,
working at the harvest. The woodman and his wife went from place to place,
offering their services, and always the wife worked with the hoe, and
the husband with the spade. Now, there was a farmer who had a field of
barley, where the ears were so long that the stalks bent down to the
ground, and the grain was very good; but the farmer could not get it all
up, so he said, ‘I will give a taler for every bushel that anyone will
pick up.’ The woodman and his wife agreed to try what they could do, and
went to the field; and the wife said, ‘I will work here, where the ground
is even, and you work by the hedge, where it is uneven.’ As they began
to work, the farmer came and looked at them; and when he saw their
strange tools, he laughed at them in his heart, and thought they would
not get much, for the hoe and the spade were not the right kind of
tools for picking up corn. However, he said nothing, but went away. The
woman worked on, and every now and then lifted up her hoe, and brought
a large dish full of corn; and the man likewise worked on, and every now
and then lifted up his spade, and brought in a dish full. The farmer came
again to look at them, and saw that the dish which the woman brought
full of corn was so heavy for her, that she could hardly carry it; and
when he went away, and came back to the field where his own people were
working, he said to them, ‘You shall not go again to the field to work,
for I have two people come who can do more than all of you; look how
they work, and how they bring in the corn.’

The farmer’s people, when they saw the woodman and his wife, were
curious to know how they could work in that manner, and went to look
on. The wolf, too, was curious to see what the woodman and his wife
would do next, and crept behind a heap of muck, that he might the better
see and hear what was going on. The man and his wife went on working,
and the woman said, ‘I must have some water to drink,’ and the man said,
‘I should like a draught of beer.’ ‘That’s right,’ said the farmer; ‘you
shall have both; only rest a while, till I get it ready.’

The wolf, who had heard all there was said, thought he should like to
have a draught of beer too, if he could get it; so he crept nearer,
that he might hear if they were going to call the farmer again. When
they began to work again, the farmer looked on, and saw that the dish
which the woman brought full of corn was so heavy for her, that she could
hardly carry it; and when he saw that, he was quite sorry to think that
two people should be able to do so much more than all his servants; so
sorry, that he could not help laughing. And when the man took up his
spade, and brought in so much corn at once, he laughed still more, and
thought to himself, ‘It is a rare thing to see people who can work like
that.’

Soon afterwards, the woman said, ‘I must have a drink of water,’ and
the man said, ‘I should like a draught of beer.’ The farmer sent his
servant boy to get it, and told him to stay with them, and see how much
they should take in at once. The boy stood behind the muck-heap, and
the wolf thought he should like to stay there too, and hear what the
boy should say, and what the man and woman should do next.

The woman went on working with her hoe, and every now and then lifted
it up, and brought in a large dish full of corn; and the man worked on
with his spade, and every now and then lifted it up, and brought in a
large dish full. The boy, who was standing behind the muck-heap, counted
how many dishes they brought in at once; and the first time it was seven,
the next time nine, and the third time eleven. When the wolf heard
that, he jumped up, and pushed the boy out of the way, and ran off with
his tail feathers flying, to get ready for merry making.

The boy was a little afraid, and ran to his master, and said, ‘I am
sure master, the woodman and his wife are very strange people; they must
be witches, for they work quite alone in the world, and nobody can tell
where they come from or where they go to.’ ‘They certainly are very
strange people,’ said the farmer; ‘but as they bring in so much corn,
they shall continue to work here; and I am quite willing to buy up all
the corn that they pick"

","The Magic Tinderbox

In a village once lived a poor man with his wife, who loved each other very much. They had nothing to eat, and nothing to wear, and the man went out into the wide world to try and earn some money, but he did not succeed, and came home again, and then there was nothing to be seen in their house but four bare walls. ‘Alas!’ said the wife, ‘what will become of us?’ ‘I will tell you what will become of us,’ answered the man; ‘we shall die of hunger.’ ‘Then had better do it at once,’ said the wife, ‘and make an end of it.’ So they sat down together on a bench, and took their hands from their breasts, and let them fall upon their laps, and died.

It happened that the man’s master came to the village, and hearing that his servant was dead, went to the house, and paid the woman what was due to her, and then went away again. But when the woman saw the money, she repented, and said, ‘I will not die, I will contrive to keep alive.’ So she took the money, and bought with it two fat geese, and cooked and ate one of them, and with the blood she painted two little cakes, and placed them on a dish, and set them in the bed where her late husband had slept, and then laid herself on the other side of the bed, and fell asleep.

Now it came to pass that the man’s ghost was at home, and he heard someone snoring in his bed. ‘Who is there?’ said he. ‘Lift thyself up,’ answered one, ‘and look round, and see who is here.’ Then he lifted himself up in the ghostly form in which he appeared, and looked round, and saw the bed full of fire, and the two cakes of bread roasting, and the goose broiling, and the woman lying on the other side. ‘Well,’ said he, ‘I know not who you are, but you have got the best of it, for I am your servant, and will do all you tell me to do.’ Then he laid himself down again, and the woman awoke, and saw two cakes roasted brown, and a fat goose broiled, and said, ‘Blessed be the day and night when I am so lucky again!’ So she ate and was satisfied, and when she had done, she fell asleep again.

The ghost of the man again appeared, and said, ‘What shall I bring you tomorrow?’ ‘Oh, ho!’ said she, ‘what a silly fellow you are! Can you not guess what I like best?’ ‘No,’ said he, ‘I cannot.’ ‘Then listen,’ said she; ‘I like brown bread and good ale best.’ ‘Is that all?’ said he, ‘that you like brown bread and good ale?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘that is all.’

The next morning, long before it was light, the woman got up, that she might see who would come. She had not long to wait, for there was a knocking at the door, and she heard a man say,

 ‘Open the door, my pretty maid,
  Open the door to thy grave,
  Open the door, I say!’

Then she went and opened it, and saw two men standing outside, one taller and thinner than the other, with a withered face, and a raven-black hat on his head.

‘Good day, good woman,’ said they; ‘what have you to sell?’

‘What will you sell?’ said she.

‘We will sell you brown bread and good ale,’ answered they.

‘What a lucky find!’ said she; ‘come in, come in!’

So she brought them in, and set them to table, and they ate and drank, and soon finished all that was got up that night for the ghost. When they had done, they paid her with a beautiful loaf of brown bread and a jug of ale, and said, ‘Will you not then let us have your handsome young man?’ ‘What handsome young man?’ said she. ‘Your handsome young man that is lying there in the bed.’ ‘Oh!’ said she, ‘he is but a silly fellow, and knows no better than to bring brown bread and good ale, and that is all he can do.’

The two men went their way, and the ghost of the man came and knocked at the door, and said, ‘What do you bring me today?’ ‘I bring you brown bread and good ale,’ answered he. ‘Alas!’ said the woman, ‘is that all you can do?’ ‘No,’ said he, ‘I have brought you something better; I have got money, and have bought food enough to last for a month.’ ‘Where have you been?’ said the woman. ‘I have been to the mill, and have turned the mill in exchange for the bread and ale.’

The next morning came the two men again, and knocked at the door, and said,

 ‘Open the door, my pretty maid,
  Open the door to thy grave,
  Open the door, I say!’

Then the woman opened the door, and said, ‘What will you sell?’ ‘We will sell you fine red wine and sweet cakes,’ answered they. ‘What a lucky find!’ said she; ‘come in, come in!’

So they came in, and sat down and ate and drank, and paid the woman with a large jug of red wine and a basketful of sweet cakes, and asked for her handsome young man. ‘Oh!’ said she, ‘he is but a silly fellow, and knows no better than to bring wine and cakes, and that is all he can do.’

The two men went their way, and the ghost came and knocked at the door, and said, ‘What do you bring me today?’ ‘I bring you wine and cakes,’ answered he. ‘Alas!’ said the woman, ‘is that all you can do?’ ‘No,’ said he, ‘I have been to the baker’s, and have helped him in the oven, and have got all that we could wish for.’

The two men came again the next morning, and knocked at the door, and said,

 ‘Open the door, my pretty maid,
  Open the door to thy grave,
  Open the door, I say!’

Then the woman opened the door, and said, ‘What will you sell?’ ‘We will sell you roast meats and fine beer,’ answered they. ‘What a lucky find!’ said she; ‘come in, come in!’

So they came in, and sat down and ate and drank, and paid the woman with a large dish of roast meat and a cask of beer, and asked for her handsome young man. ‘Oh!’ said she, ‘he is but a silly fellow, and knows no better than to bring roast meat and beer, and that is all he can do.’

The two men went their way, and the ghost came and knocked at the door, and said, ‘What do you bring me today?’ ‘I bring you roast meat and beer,’ answered he. ‘Alas!’ said the woman, ‘is that all you can do?’ ‘No,’ said he, ‘I have been to the butcher’s, and have helped him to kill a calf, and have got the best of the meat, and have got the best of the beer that was in the cellar.’

The two men came again the next morning, and knocked at the door, and said,

 ‘Open the door, my pretty maid,
  Open the door to thy grave,
  Open the door, I say!’

Then the woman opened the door, and said, ‘What will you sell?’ ‘We will sell you a fine fat calf,’ answered they. ‘What a lucky find!’ said she; ‘come in, come in!’

So they came in, and said, ‘We will only take our pay this time, and not sell"

","There was once a king who had a beautiful garden, planted with all sorts
of fine trees and flowers. In the midst of the garden stood a large pond
of clear water, and in the pond lived a golden fish. This golden fish
was much more beautiful than all the other fish in the pond, and it
swam about in the water with a great many small golden fishes, which
were its children.

Now it came to pass that the king fell very ill, and thought of nothing
but how he should amuse himself when he should get well. Then his court
was told to invent something that should make him merry. So they built a
beautiful palace of glass, in the garden, close by the pond, and the
king was told that in this palace lived a golden fish, which was more
beautiful than all the fish in the world. And when the king was well
enough to go out, he went into the glass palace, and looked down into
the clear water, and there he saw the golden fish swimming about with
its children. And he watched them so long that his heart rejoiced within
him, and he said, ‘I will take the golden fish home with me, and it
shall swim in a golden bowl in one of my palace rooms.’ Then the king
spoke to his court, and said, ‘How can it be brought about that the
golden fish comes home with me?’ The court answered, ‘That can be done
easily enough; you only have to send one of your people to take hold of
it, and lift it out of the water.’ But the king said, ‘No, that will not
do; the golden fish must come willingly.’ Then the cook was sent into
the garden, and told to catch the golden fish, and bring it home alive
and unwilling.

Now the cook took a large net, and went into the garden, and peeped into
the glass palace. Then he laid the net carefully over the pond, and
waited till the golden fish came close to the top. But when it saw the
net, it darted away as quickly as lightning, and the cook had waited in
vain. So he went home and told the king that it was impossible to catch
the golden fish, for it always saw the net and swam away. Then the king
said, ‘Then shall nothing be lacking for my table but the golden fish;
but when I am eating it, it shall be unwilling to come.’

The next day the cook went again into the garden, and took with him a
large piece of bread, and scattered it over the water. Then came all
the small golden fishes and many other fishes, and ate the bread, and
were quite busy in doing so. But the golden fish stayed below, and did
not come up at all. However, the cook waited till all the other fishes
had eaten enough and were finished, and then he took his net, and made
a snap at the golden fish, and brought it away with him.

As soon as the fish felt itself in the net, it knew that it should be
taken home to the king’s table unwilling, and in its grief and anger it
became as heavy as lead. The cook could hardly lift it up, and carried
it out of the garden with the greatest trouble. Then he put it into a
large bowl of water which he had brought thither with him, and carried
it in his turn to the king.

When the king saw the golden fish lying at the bottom of the bowl, he
could not help laughing, and said, ‘Alas, poor fish! thou art sure to
be eaten, but wilt thou not eat anything before thine hour comes?’ Then
the cook went and fetched some of the water out of the pond, in which
the golden fish had lived, and put some of the water-plants in the bowl
with the fish. But the golden fish did not touch a single drop of the
water, or any of the plants; and when the cook had gone away, it threw
itself backwards and forwards in the bowl with all its strength.

The king was much grieved to see this, and said, ‘Poor golden fish! wilt
thou not eat anything? I will myself fetch thee some of the finest
food. Haste ye, therefore, and let all the cooks in the palace come
here, and cook whatever they most like, and I will see whether there
is not something here that will please thee.’ Then the king had the
water out of the bowl taken away, and ordered the best cooks to come
thither and cook for the golden fish. One cooked a fine dainty of fish
from the pond, and another cooked a fine roast fish, and a third cooked
a dish of fish soup, and all other kinds of good things that fish can
eat. But the golden fish saw them all, and would not eat a single thing.

Then the king grew very angry, and said, ‘You must die, after all, but
you shall at least taste death with a good appetite. I will have you
cooked myself.’ And the cooks cut up the golden fish, and put it on the
grate, and made a fire under it, and let it roast. But the golden fish
did not stop to be roasted; it suddenly sprang out of the oven, and in
its fright leapt into the king’s face. Then the king could not help
laughing, and said, ‘Will you be at peace now? You have had your way,
and you have come home unwilling. Now eat as much as you like, only do
not forget that I am to eat you afterwards.’

Thereupon the golden fish became quite friendly, and ate heartily, and
when it had had enough, it laid itself quietly at the bottom of the
bowl, and did not move again.

The king had the bowl of water carried back to the garden, and put the
golden fish again in the pond where it had lived. And from that time
forth, it came daily to the glass palace, and let itself be taken up,
and was carried to the king’s table; and when it saw the king, it laid
itself down quietly in the bowl, and ate whatever was put before it.
And so the king always had a merry meal, for as long as he lived.

","The Shepherd Boy and the Wolf

In a village lived a shepherd boy, who had a faithful dog named
Sharpy. The boy was very fond of his dog, and took great care of him,
giving him plenty of food, and letting him lie in his bed with him
at night.

One day the shepherd took his flock to the wood to feed, and the boy
and Sharpy went with him. After they had been there some time, the
shepherd said, ‘I am going to look for some wood, and will not be back
until evening; take care that the sheep do not run away, and that no
wolf comes and carries one off.’

As soon as the shepherd was out of sight, the boy and Sharpy sat
down under a tree to rest, and the boy said, ‘Sharpy, we will take
turns to watch the sheep, and sleep by turns; you shall watch first,
and I will sleep a while.’ So Sharpy watched the sheep, and the boy
fell asleep.

Now it so happened that a wolf came creeping by, and seeing the sheep
so easily taken care of, began to think how he might get one of them
for his supper. At length he picked out a very fat sheep, and crept up
quite close to it, ready to pounce and kill it. But as he was getting
ready, he heard a dog snarling, and looking round saw Sharpy lying
close by the sheep. ‘That won’t do,’ said the wolf; ‘if that dog had
a mind to he would certainly bite me; I must get him out of the way.’
So the wolf crept up quietly to Sharpy, and seized him by the throat,
and shook him so that the bones rang together. Sharpy, however, held
on his ground, and bit the wolf’s face, till at last the wolf let him
go, and ran off howling, cursing, and spitting blood, into the wood.

Sharpy soon recovered, and having barked and whined till the shepherd
boy awoke, told his tale. Then the boy said, ‘Whoever that was, he
meant mischief; let us away to the shepherd, and tell him of it.’ So
they took the sheep, and went in search of the shepherd, who when he
heard what had happened was very angry, and said, ‘You have done well,
Sharpy, to defend yourself, but you should have watched more closely,
for it was a wolf who came to carry off one of the sheep.’ ‘Then,
master,’ said the boy, ‘shall I watch now, or sleep?’ ‘Watch, you
good-for-nothing,’ said the shepherd; ‘watch, and if the wolf comes,
you must give him battle, and I’ll soon come up and help you.’

So the boy watched, and Sharpy lay down close to him. After a time
the wolf came creeping up, and seeing that all was safe, began to be
of a mind to carry off one of the sheep. But Sharpy saw him, and
sprang upon him, and bit him in the leg. The wolf, however, soon got
away from him, and ran into the wood. Then the boy called out, ‘Master
shepherd, master shepherd!’ But the shepherd said, ‘Sharpy, you have
done well, go on and watch; I shall soon come up to you.’

In another hour or so the wolf came back, and determined upon a new
stratagem. He began to eat some of the grass, and made a show of
eating very heartily; then he looked round, and saw the boy sleeping,
and that Sharpy was lying down. ‘All is safe,’ said he to himself;
‘this time I shall get my sheep.’ So he crept up quietly, and was
just going to seize one, when down went Sharpy upon him, and held him
fast. The wolf, however, struggled and struggled, but all in vain;
at last he gave up all hopes of getting away, and said, ‘Will you
and I make a bargain? If you let me go, I will not touch your sheep.’
‘No,’ said Sharpy, ‘I will not let you go unless you promise not to
come back again.’ ‘That is asking too much,’ said the wolf; ‘how can I
be sure you will let me go when I have kept my word?’ ‘I don’t know,’
said Sharpy; ‘but if you will not make the bargain I shall not let
you go at all.’

So the wolf saw that he should get nothing by parleying, and said,
‘Very well, I will trust you; you shall have my word not to touch your
sheep, and not to come back again.’ ‘And now,’ said Sharpy, ‘as you
have used such cunning to get my boy to trust you, you shall have
my word not to bite you again.’

Then the wolf really went away, and did not come back to the wood for
a long time to come.

At last, however, he gathered together all the wolves in the country,
and they came creeping and crawling into the wood where the shepherd’s
flock was. And the wolf said, ‘I want to tell you that the shepherd’s
boy and his dog Sharpy are lying there, and we may get all their
sheep without any trouble.’ ‘Where are they?’ said the other wolves.
‘Asleep,’ answered the wolf; ‘they think we have forgotten them, and
do not suspect any mischief.’

Then the wolves were glad to hear this, and all of them set to work
at once to carry off the sheep. The boy and Sharpy soon awoke, and
the boy said, ‘Sharpy, we shall not be able to keep off all this
pack of wolves; let us run and give the alarm to the shepherd.’ But
Sharpy said, ‘No, we must try to save all the sheep; if we lose one
it will be a great pity; the shepherd can come and help us.’

So on they went, barking and snarling, at the wolves, and the wolves
at them; but the wolves were many, and the boy and Sharpy were but
two, and every now and then a wolf got past them, and carried off a
sheep. At last the boy saw that all was in vain, and called out as
loud as he could, ‘Shepherd, shepherd!’ But the shepherd did not come
soon, and every minute saw one of the flock carried off. At last the
shepherd came; and when he saw what had happened, and that only one
sheep was left, he called out, ‘Sharpy, Sharpy!’ Then up went Sharpy
to him, and the shepherd caught him by the ear, and scolded him, and
said, ‘You who should have watched have let all the sheep go, and I
am sure I don’t know what will become of you.’

‘Oh, master,’ said Sharpy, ‘the wolves came, and I could not help
much, for they were so many, and we were but two; and the boy here
did not help at all, for he slept all the time.’ ‘And you, my boy,’
said the shepherd, ‘why did you not come and wake me up when you
called?’ ‘I did call, master,’ said the boy, ‘but you did not hear
me.’

Then the shepherd said, ‘You have both been very silly; I have had
you both a long while, and I thought you had some sense. Sharpy, you
shall have no more sleeping by the sheep; you must lie at the end of
the village, where you will be safe; and,"

","There was once a poor widow who lived with her two children in a lonely cottage
among the mountains. The children were called Hans and Christel, and their
mother loved them dearly, but they had little to eat, and often went to bed
hungry.

One winter’s night, when the snow had fallen deep in the woods, and the wind
howled dismally round the cottage, Hans awoke and said to his mother, ‘I am
so hungry that I cannot sleep; let Christel and I go out and cut some wood,
and I am sure I shall be able to work up enough energy to earn something by
it.’ ‘Alas! my poor child,’ said the mother, ‘it is so dark and stormy that you
cannot go out, and even if you could, there is not a stick of wood to be had
within many a mile.’ ‘I must try,’ said Hans, ‘I will take Christel with me,
and if we are in danger we will come back.’ So they wrapped themselves in
their cloaks, and girded on their little scythes, and went forth into the
storm.

They had not gone far before they saw two lights in the distance, moving about
here and there, and going up and down like a dance. ‘See,’ said Hans to
Christel, ‘it must be good fairies who are dancing there, and they are so
merry that they are not afraid of the storm; let us go and look at them,
and if they are kind fairies perhaps they will give us something to eat.’

So they went nearer and nearer, till at last they came close to the two lights,
and saw that they were torches held in the hands of two little dwarfs, who were
working hard and gathering up the wood upon a sledge. Hans and Christel stood
watching them for a while, and then Hans cried out, ‘Why do you work so hard,
you little men?’ ‘Because,’ answered the dwarfs, ‘we have to gather wood
till daylight, and then we have not leisure so much as to light our pipes at
our ease.’ ‘What do you want with wood?’ said Hans. ‘Why, we light our fires
with it,’ answered the dwarfs, ‘and then we can warm ourselves a little, for
the storm and the cold wind are so sharp that we cannot stand it.’ ‘Where do
you live?’ asked Hans. ‘In that cavern,’ said the dwarfs, pointing to a deep
hole in the mountain. ‘How very nice and snug that must be!’ said Hans, ‘with
your fire burning all the year round!’ ‘Yes,’ said the dwarfs, ‘but the wind
blows so through the mountains that the cold air comes in, and then we have
to get up and shut the doors.’

Hans and Christel began to pity the little dwarfs, and said, ‘We will work
with you, and help you to gather wood, in return for something to eat and
drink.’ So they took each dwarf by the hand, and brought him home with them,
and when their mother saw four little men in the cottage, she was very much
frightened, and tried to push them out again; but they begged for mercy, and
said they were very cold and wet, and would only stay to dry themselves by
the fire.

So they sat down and rested, and then began to tell the children all they
knew about the world, and about the fairies and the birds and the beasts; and
they told tales of all the mischief that wicked witches and bad fairies do
in the world, and how they spoil the poor and good, and make themselves
dainty meals of them. And they told many merry tales of their own, of the
pranks they had played upon one another, and of the tricks they had played
upon the bears and the foxes, and all the birds and beasts.

When it came to be time to go to bed, the mother said, ‘Pray let us have one
of your fine torches to light us up the stairs.’ ‘With all my fortune,’ said
the dwarfs, and they gave her one of their torches, and it burned for three
days and three nights, and then went out.

The next morning the children rose early, and went with the dwarfs into the
wood to work; and Hans cut a great deal, and Christel gathered it up upon a
sledge, and the two little men watched and made all right. When noon came,
the mother brought them out a loaf of bread and a little pot of ale, and they
sat down and ate and drank, and then went on with their work till it began
to be dark. Then the children said they must go home, for they could not see
the way, but the dwarfs begged that they would take them home with them, for
they did not like to go home alone to their cold cavern.

So they took them in, and when the mother saw four people at her table she
was very much frightened, and wished that she had ten times as many to wish
them away. But they begged for some little room where they could sleep, and
at last she showed them a very small closet under the stairs. So they took
their torches and went in, and the mother shut the door and locked it. But
when she went to bed, she heard a most violent noise and clattering, as if
all the torches in the world were breaking at once, and a great part of the
house was shaken to pieces.

The next morning she went to the little room to see what was the matter, and
to her great wonder and fright the four little men were still there; but they
bowed to her very deep, and said they could not get out, for somebody had
locked the door and carried away the key. Then she was very much grieved,
and said she dared not keep them, and they said she must let them have something
to eat and drink, or they should die for hunger. So she gave them some bread
and milk, and after that they worked hard, and cut and planed and carved,
and made all kinds of beautiful things, till the mother told them they might
have whatever she had in the house, only they must tell her what they
wanted, for she would get it for them.

They worked on thus for some time, and then said they must have some clothes
to put on, for their old ones were all worn out. And the mother said, ‘I will
weave you some shirts and jackets and waistcoats and hose, of the finest linen
and the best colours, only tell me what you want each for.’ So they said,
‘One of us will have a red waistcoat, and another a yellow, and the third a
green, and the fourth a blue.’ And when the shirts and jackets were ready,
they were all pleased, and said they had never seen or worn such fine
things.

Then they said they must have hats to put on, and the mother said she would
weave them four of the finest straw hats, with broad red ribbons; and they
said she should have gold for the ribbons, and as much gold and silver as
she could carry.

But when the hats were ready, and they were going to put on the ribbons, they
said they would have no red ribbons, but that the first should have a
white, the second a yellow, the third a green, and the fourth a blue ribbon.
Then the mother was very angry, and said, ‘You ungrateful creatures! you
promised me gold for the ribbons, and I have given you the best I had, and
you like them not, and will have common colours!’ And away she went and wept
bitterly.

However, she soon comforted herself, for she found that she had more money
than she had ever"

","The Three Little Pigs and the Wolf

Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who set out to build themselves
homes. The first pig built his house of straw. The second pig built his house of
sticks. But the wise little pig built his house of bricks.

Now it came to pass that a wolf came by. ‘Halloo! Halloo!’ cried he, ‘which of
you little pigs is at home?’

‘Here am I!’ said the first pig, who lived in the straw house. ‘Come in, come
in!’ he cried, and the wolf pushed the door aside and went in, and before the
pig could say ‘How-do-you-do,’ down went wolf, with cracking and crackling. But
the wolf jumped up, shook himself, and said: ‘You silly pig, what a paltry house
you have built! I will soon finish it for you.’ So saying, he drew a deep breath,
and blew the house down. Then the wolf turned to the pig and said: ‘Now, pig,
how do you like that?’ But the pig said nothing, for the wolf had already run
out, and was hurrying down the road to the second pig’s house.

‘Halloo! Halloo!’ cried the wolf, ‘who lives here?’

‘Here I do!’ said the second pig, who lived in the house of sticks. ‘Come in,
come in!’ he cried, and the wolf pushed the door aside, and in he went. ‘How
now, pig?’ said the wolf, ‘how do you like that?’

But the pig, like the first, said nothing, for the wolf had already run out of
the house, and was making the best of his way to the brick house.

‘Halloo! Halloo!’ cried the wolf, ‘who lives here?’

‘Here I do!’ said the wise little pig, who lived in the house of brick. ‘Come
in, come in!’ cried the pig, and the wolf, thinking it was the same kind of
house as the others, pushed the door aside and went in. But the wolf soon
found out his mistake. ‘You silly wolf!’ said the pig, ‘you would have done
well to have eaten up both your brothers, and then you would have had some
brains.’

‘What’s that you say?’ cried the wolf.

‘I say,’ answered the pig, ‘that you would have done well to have eaten up both
your brothers, and then you would have had some brains.’

Then the wolf, who was very angry, cried: ‘I’ll eat you, and then you’ll have
plenty of brains to be of use to you!’

‘Come along,’ said the pig, ‘there’s plenty of room for you. If you please to
sit yourself down on that stool, and let me tie your legs with this rope, you
will save me a great deal of trouble.’

The wolf sat down, and the pig put a rope round his legs, and said: ‘Just wait
a little, I must soon fetch some water to cook you in.’

Then the pig ran out of the house, and bolted the door. ‘Wolf,’ he cried, ‘you
shall have plenty of water to drink, for you will be cooked in it.’

The wolf began to be afraid, and said: ‘I see what you are about, you sly pig,
you will be too quick for me!’

But the pig came back with a bucket of water, and threw it over the wolf’s
head, and the wolf, with a splash, went off in a rage, and the door was
bolted.

","Once upon a time, there was a poor woodcutter who lived with his wife and two children in a little cottage at the edge of a great dark forest. One day, as he was going through the forest to sell his wares in the town, he cut down a tree, and as he was pulling it away, he saw a little child in ragged clothes lying on the ground and crying. ‘Poor little thing,’ said the woodcutter, ‘who has forsaken thee? Come with me, and I will take care of thee.’ So he picked up the child, and took it home to his wife, and gave it some of the milk that he had with him, and said, ‘I will take care of this little child, and we will bring him up with Dick and Mary.’ ‘Oh, yes,’ said the wife, ‘he may well have some of our milk; his mother must have died, and he will, no doubt, be thankful to have bread to eat, and fire to warm him.’

So they brought up the little child with their own, and he grew strong and healthy, and was soon as fat and rosy as Dick and Mary. But one day, as the woodcutter was going out to the forest to cut wood, he saw a man coming towards him, who seemed to be in great trouble. ‘What makes that, my friend?’ said the woodcutter. ‘Alas!’ replied the other, ‘my little child has run away from me, and I know not where to find him. Pray look in your hut, for if he has gone there, he may have been tired and gone to sleep.’ The woodcutter told him that a little child had been found in the forest, and that they had brought him up with their own children; but they knew nothing of where he came from, and had never seen anyone looking for him. ‘Oh, heavens!’ cried the man, ‘that little child must be mine! I will go with you and see him.’ Then he went in, and as soon as the little child saw him, he threw his arms round the man’s neck, and said, ‘Father! father!’ Then the man fell on his knees, and kissed him, and said, ‘Yes, indeed, my son, you are my son; I am your father, and I have been looking for you three long years.’

The woodcutter and his wife were very much grieved to see their little foster-child go away, but they could not help wishing that the poor man would provide for him, as he seemed so glad to have him back again. So they asked him if he would not take him with him into the town where he lived, for it would be a great place for him to go to, where there would be schools and everything else to teach him. ‘Yes,’ said the man, ‘I will take him with me, and I will provide for him.’ Then he took the little boy on his knee, and said, ‘Now, my son, tell me true what you were doing in the forest.’ ‘I was looking for my father,’ said the boy. ‘Where did you get that fine cloak which you are wearing?’ asked the man. ‘I found it lying on the ground,’ said the boy. ‘Where did you get the golden cup which I see you holding in your hand?’ ‘I found it in the brook,’ replied the boy. ‘And where did you get the horse that you are riding?’ ‘I found him standing at the gate of the forest,’ said the boy.

The man listened to what the boy said, and then he called his servants together, and told them what had happened. ‘Go into the town,’ said he, ‘and search in the market, and you will see a cloak there which is exactly like the one my son has got; and go to the goldsmith’s shop, and you will find a golden cup like the one he is holding; and go to the stables, and you will see a horse like the one he is riding.’ Then the servants went and looked, and everything the man had said was true; so they brought the merchant before the judge, and he was sentenced to lose his son for having stolen him.

","There was once a forester who had a faithful and diligent servant, called
Karl, who was respected and loved by all, and who had a good and honest
heart. It happened that the forester had to go into the town on some
business, and took his wife with him; so that Karl was left in charge of
the house. It was about Christmas-time, and the snow lay deep upon the
ground. One evening, as Karl was sitting by the fire, he heard a gentle
tapping at the window. He went and opened it, and saw a little grey
mouse standing outside, who said to him: ‘Oh, do let me in! The snow is
so deep, and I am so cold and hungry!’ ‘Come in then,’ said Karl, ‘and
welcome! but you must take care not to run about and disturb the
household, or you will have worse than a rod beaten for it.’ Then he
brought the mouse to the fire, and gave it a piece of bread and butter,
and set a dish of milk close by it. The mouse ate and drank, and then
stretched itself, and said: ‘Oh, it is so pleasant here! but I must go
now, or I shall be late.’ ‘Where do you want to go at this time of night?’
asked Karl. ‘I want to visit all my friends,’ answered the mouse, ‘and
every one invites me to his house, but I have such a long way to go!’

As the mouse was so pretty and pleasant, Karl could not help giving it
leave to go about the house as little as possible. The next day, when
the forester and his wife returned home, they were astonished to see a
little table and chair standing in the corner, and a small knife and fork,
and a plate and bowl, all of solid silver. ‘Who has been here?’ said the
wife. ‘I let a poor little grey mouse in last night because he was so
cold and hungry, and I think he must have got a table and chairs for
himself somewhere.’ ‘I don’t know where he got them,’ said the forester’s
wife; ‘but I don’t like the company we have been keeping, and I wish
you had not been so soft-hearted.’

The next day the forester went into the town, and the wife was alone
with Karl. In the evening, when the snow still continued to fall, she
heard a gentle tapping at the window, and opening it she saw a little
snowflake standing without, that said: ‘Let me in, I am so very cold!’
‘Where do you come from?’ asked the wife. ‘I am the king of the Snow
People,’ answered the snowflake, ‘and we have had a great feast today,
and now I am left behind, and am so very cold!’ ‘But you are not a very
large guest,’ said the wife, ‘you may come in, but you must not take
up too much room.’ Then she brought the snowflake to the fire, and gave
it a drop of brandy and a piece of sugar, and set it on a plate close
by the fire. The snowflake soon stopped shaking, and said: ‘Now I can
stay here till my people are finished with their merry-making, and then
I will go home.’ Before the night was half gone, the snowflake said: ‘I
must be going home now.’ ‘Where do you want to go at this time of night?’
asked the wife. ‘I want to visit all my friends,’ answered the snowflake,
‘and every one invites me to his house, but I have such a long way to
go!’ ‘You may go anywhere you please,’ said the wife; ‘but take care you
do not disturb my house, or you will have worse than a rod beaten for
it.’ Then the snowflake went away.

The next morning there stood on the table a great snow-sleigh with eight
snow-horses, and a little house all of solid silver. ‘Oh!’ cried the
wife, ‘what shall we do?’ The servant Karl said: ‘I think the Snow King
must have sent them as a reward for my kindness to his messenger.’ ‘But
I don’t like them,’ said the wife; ‘I am sure they bring nothing but
trouble with them.’

The forester did not come home that night, and the wife was alone with
Karl. Towards evening there was a gentle tapping at the window, and
opening it she saw a little piece of the midge fluttering about, that
said: ‘Let me in, I am so very cold and hungry!’ ‘Where do you come from?’
asked the wife. ‘I am the king of the Midge People,’ answered the midge;
‘we have had a grand feast today, and now I have been left behind, and
am so very cold and hungry!’ ‘But you are not a very large guest,’ said
the wife; ‘you may come in, but take care you don’t trouble the house,
or you will have worse than a rod beaten for it.’ Then she brought the
midge to the fire, and gave it a drop of brandy and a piece of sugar,
and set it on a plate close by the fire. The midge soon stopped shaking,
and said: ‘Now I can stay here till my people are finished with their
merry-making, and then I will go home.’ Before the night was half gone,
the midge said: ‘I must be going home now.’ ‘Where do you want to go at
this time of night?’ asked the wife. ‘I want to visit all my friends,’
answered the midge, ‘and every one invites me to his house, but I have
such a long way to go!’ ‘You may go wherever you please,’ said the wife;
‘but take care you don’t disturb my house, or you will have worse than
a rod beaten for it.’ Then the midge went away.

The next morning there stood on the table a great midges’ house all of
solid silver. ‘Oh!’ cried the wife, ‘what shall we do?’ The servant Karl
said: ‘I think the Midge King must have sent it as a reward for my
kindness to his messenger.’ ‘But I don’t like it,’ said the wife; ‘I am
sure it brings nothing but trouble with it.’

The forester did not come home the next night either, and the wife was
alone with Karl. Towards evening there was a gentle tapping at the window,
and opening it she saw a little feather from a goose standing without,
that said: ‘Let me in, I am so very cold and hungry!’ ‘Where do you come
from?’ asked the wife. ‘I am the king of the Wild Geese,’ answered the
goose feather; ‘we have had a grand feast today, and now I have been
left behind, and am so very cold and hungry!’ ‘But you are not a very
large guest,’ said the wife; ‘you may come in, but take care you don’t
trouble the house, or you will have worse than a rod beaten for it.’
Then she brought the goose feather to the fire, and gave it a drop of
brandy and a piece of sugar, and set it on a plate close by the fire.
The feather soon stopped shaking, and said: ‘Now I can stay here till

‘I want to visit all my friends,’ answered the goose feather, ‘and every
one invites me to his house, but I have such a long way to go!’"

","The Enchanted Ring

In a village in the Black Forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife, and
they had one child, a daughter, who was very beautiful. And when she was twelve
years old, she was as beautiful as the prettiest bird that ever flew. And the
wood-cutter and his wife loved her dearly, and she was like a little lamb to
them.

One day the father cut too deep, and the axe fell, and the blood gushed
abundantly. He was very frightened, and cried out: ‘Alas! what shall we do? I
am dying, and who will provide for our dear little daughter?’ ‘Be quiet,’ said
his wife, ‘I will go into the forest and pray God to save your life, and I am
sure if He grants my request, I will do him one in return, and grant one wish to
the first creature, be it man or beast, that meets me.’ So she went, and when
her prayer was heard, and her husband’s life was saved, a little grey mouse
ran up to her foot, and cried out: ‘Good woman, grant me one piece of bread,
and I will be very thankful.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said the woman, ‘take
away as much as you will.’ Then the mouse spread her little feet, and took
away a lump of bread as big as a loaf, and ran away with it into the hole under
the stairs. The next day the wood-cutter’s wife went again into the forest to
pray, and said: ‘Dear God, I am so very happy that my husband’s life has been
spared, that I wish one of our dearest wishes to be granted. We have a
beautiful child, and I wish that she may some day marry a king.’ When she had
finished her prayer, and was returning home, a bird with golden wings flew
up to her, and cried out: ‘Good woman, grant me the boon of one wish, and I
will be very thankful.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said she, ‘take what you will.’
Then the bird spread its wings, and took away so much food as would have
supported the whole village for a whole year, and flew away.

Soon afterwards a suitor came from a great way off, who said he was a king’s
son, and when he saw the wood-cutter’s daughter, he was so enamoured of her
beauty that he wished to marry her. But the mother said: ‘I know the father
was once a poor man, and I have made a wish that my daughter should marry a
king.’ Then the suitor said: ‘I am a king’s son,’ and the wedding was soon
celebrated.

The young queen had a beautiful palace built, and lived there very happily
with her husband for a long time. But at length he said to her: ‘I am told
that in the Black Forest there is a hidden treasure, and I wish you would go
there, and bring me all the gold and jewels that you can find.’ Then the queen
answered: ‘I will do it gladly, for your sake, and will stay there three days
and three nights.’ So she took leave of her husband, and went her way, and
when she came to the Black Forest she heard a sound of merry music. She
followed it, and saw a company of dwarfs dancing and capering together, and
in the middle of them was a handsome young man. Then the dwarfs missed their
companion, and cried out: ‘All is lost! we have been treacherously betrayed!
has not the time come for us to take our revenge?’ And they seized her, and
took her before an old woman, who sat in judgement over them. And the old
dame said: ‘You have brought misfortune on us by your visit; we will punish
you for it, and you shall wear the iron ring.’ Then they bound her feet and
hands, and put the iron ring on her finger, and led her away to a cave.

There she saw a great heap of gold and jewels, and the dwarfs said to her: ‘You
must sit here, and count the jewels, and when you have done that, and have
worn away the iron ring, you shall be set free, and we will give you as much
as you can carry away with you.’ Then they left her alone, but she saw that
the task would be a hard one, for the ring grew larger and larger, and hurt
her finger very much. At first she counted the jewels, but when she had been
three days and three nights looking at them without being able to tell how
many there were, she was very much frightened, and began to feel very sad and
miserable.

She stayed on for seven years, and every day she took a little walk in the
cave, and at last she came to a door which she had not found before. And
when she opened it, there lay a little bread and a drop of wine, and a light
burned in the chamber. And she ate of the bread and drank of the wine, and
felt a little stronger, and sat down and watched the light. And soon the
little grey mouse, that had been her first benefactor, came crawling in, and
said: ‘Why have you forsaken us, dear queen? we have been faithful to you,
and you have forgotten us.’ Then she told them all her sorrows, and how she
had been forced to stay there against her will, and how she could not free
herself from the iron ring. But the mouse said: ‘Late at night, when all the
dwarfs are asleep, go to the door, and take off the iron ring, and throw it
into the water that runs in front of the palace, and come back and put on
another ring that lies upon a chest in your bed-chamber, and that will be
our reward.’

The queen did as she was told, and when she awoke in the morning the iron
ring was gone, and on her finger was another of gold, and the day after that
another still, and every day a finer ring, until at last all her misfortunes
were at an end. And she counted up all the jewels, and put them in a sack,
and took them with her when she went away.

She journeyed on for many days and nights, till at length she came to a
hill, and at the top of the hill sat an old man, who bade her welcome, and
said: ‘Where do you come from, dear child?’ ‘From the Black Forest,’ said
she. ‘What have you there?’ asked the old man. ‘Jewels and gold,’ answered
she. ‘How much?’ ‘Enough to support you and yours for many generations.’
‘Will you give them to me?’ said the old man. ‘No,’ said she, ‘I will keep
them for myself.’ But the old man said: ‘If you will not give them to me,
you will at least give them to my son, who is king of this country.’ Then she
said: ‘I will willingly give them to your son, on one condition; that is,
that he will take them, and not leave me without marrying me.’ The old man
agreed to this, and the son came, and married her, and they lived happily
together till the end of their days.

","There was once a poor woodman who cut wood in the forest, and lived with his wife in a
hut upon the outskirts of a village. One evening, as he was sitting by the fire, he
said to her: ‘I will not go into the forest again, for I am sure I shall see a bear, and
if he gets hold of me, what chance shall I have?’ ‘Do not be afraid,’ said his wife,
‘only take the little knife that I have given you, and keep it always by you.’ Next
morning, the woodman took his axe and went into the forest. Suddenly a bear met
him, and seized him so that he could not move. In spite of all his struggles, the bear
held him fast, and would have killed him, if God had not helped him. For as the bear
was tearing him with his claws, the little knife which his wife had given him, fell out
of his pocket. The bear saw the knife, and let the woodman go, that he might pick
up the knife. The woodman, therefore, quickly ran away, and the bear, thinking that
he wanted to run away with the knife, would not venture to go after him.

The woodman, however, did not run away too fast, but stood still and looked back
at the bear. Then the bear said: ‘Good woodman, why do you forsake your country?
I am a mighty sorcerer, and can grant you great riches. Only listen well to what I
say. Every year, when the cherry-trees in the valley begin to bloom, go thither and
you will find a golden egg. Take it away with you, and every day one of your children
shall sit in the forest and watch it, until another egg follows. When eight such eggs
have been gathered, a beautiful hall will stand in your country, full of gold and
silver, and you will be a rich man.’ The woodman agreed to this, and when the time
came, and the cherry-trees began to bloom, he went into the valley, and found the
first golden egg. His eldest son and daughter sat with him and watched it, and the
second year another egg was found, and the second children watched it, and so on
year by year, until all eight eggs were found, and the youngest watched the eighth.
Then a beautiful palace of gold and silver stood in the woodman’s country, full of
treasures, as the bear had said.

The woodman became very rich, and thought only of his riches, and forgot the God
who had given them to him. He no longer offered up any prayer to Him, nor did he
remember the poor and needy. And God, who sees all, was grieved at his heartlessness,
and sent a famine throughout the land. The woodman, however, still had plenty of
money, and said: ‘The Lord hath blessed me abundantly, and hath given me all these
riches, that I may enjoy them.’

Then he built a great table, and laid it with all kinds of rich fare, and sent servants
into every land, to hunt out the best wines in the world, until his cellar was full.
And every day he sat down and feasted, and grew fat and sleek, and forgot the God
who had created him.

Meantime the famine became so great that no one could support himself, and people
came from a great way to beg alms of him. But the woodman’s heart was hardened,
and he gave them nothing, and said: ‘What have I to do with the poor wretches? Let
them die and trouble me no more.’

Now there was a man in the land, whose only son was very dear to him, but he was
sick unto death, and no physician could heal him. Then his father went to the rich
woodman, and fell on his knees before him, and besought him, saying: ‘If thou wilt
give me my son again, and he shall be as other men, I will give thee all that I
have, yea, and myself will become thy servant for ever.’ The woodman looked at him
scornfully, and said: ‘I will heal thy son, but thou shalt give me thy only daughter
to wife.’ The man consented to this, and went home rejoicing, and his son was
cured.

The woodman, however, married the daughter, and thought he should now have some
rest, and could enjoy his riches in peace. But God had not forgotten him. There came
a time when he could no longer feast and make merry, for the famine became still
more cruel, and people died like flies. Then the woodman was grieved, and said:
‘I will give food to the whole land, and let mine own want what it will.’ So he
caused all his golden and silver ware to be melted down, and made bread and beef and
wine for the people, and thus the land was relieved.

And now came the bear, who had been sent by God, and said to him: ‘Why have you
done this? Why have you given food to the people? Have you forgotten that you are
a rich man, and that you have a palace full of gold and silver? You have acted like
a fool.’ Then the woodman said: ‘I am indeed a fool, but my heart is lighted within
me, and I feel as if I were quite a new man.’

The bear was angry at this, and threatened him with a still greater punishment, if
he had not used his riches as he ought. ‘I will soon come again,’ said he, and
went away.

The woodman, however, did not care what the bear said, but went on doing good to
the people, and gave away all that he had, until there remained nothing of his
riches. Then the bear came back a second time, and said: ‘Why have you done this?
Have you forgotten that you are a rich man? You have been a fool indeed!’ ‘I acknowledge
that I have been a fool,’ said the woodman, ‘but my heart is so light within me,
that I cannot help it. I feel as if I were quite a new man.’

The bear was very angry at this, and threatened him with still heavier punishment,
if he did not use his riches as he ought. ‘I will soon come again,’ said he, and
went away.

The woodman, however, did not care for the bear’s threats, but went on doing good,
and gave away all that he had, until there remained nothing of his riches. Then the
bear came back a third time, and said: ‘Why have you done this? Have you forgotten
that you are a rich man? You have been a very foolish man indeed!’ ‘I acknowledge
that I have been a fool,’ answered the woodman, ‘but my heart is so light within
me, that I cannot help it. I feel as if I were quite a new man.’

The bear was very angry at this, and cried out: ‘You refractory rascal! You have
used my treasures, but have given them away again. Now then, you shall fare as I
am pleased to will. You shall become a bird, and fly away through the world, and
never more return to your country.’ So the woodman at once took wing, and flew
away, and his wife went with him. Thus were they punished for having forgotten God.

The bear went to the palace, and cried out with his mighty voice: ‘I am a mighty
sorcerer, and have power over all the world. Every year, when the cherry-trees in
the valley begin to bloom, go thither and you will find a golden egg. Take it away
with you, and every day one of your children shall sit in the forest and watch it,
until another egg follows. When eight such eggs have been gathered, a beautiful

","The Snow Queen

Long, long ago, in the cold country up under the North Star, there lived a poor old woman, who could foretell the future. She had a beautiful daughter, whose eyes were like the prettiest stars in the sky. One day, when the little girl was playing by the sea, a burning coal from a ship that passed by fell into her eye, and the old woman was so frightened, that she said: ‘The bloodthirsty Snow Queen has pierced your eye with her arrow, and you will die some day.’ Then she took a brush of fine sable, and painted an eye in the girl’s face, so that no one should know that the real eye was gone.

Poor Lina had to keep herself hidden away from the world, for she was very beautiful, and everyone who saw her was made unhappy.

One day, when the snowflakes were falling around, and the rosy clouds in the sky looked like flames, the Snow Queen came and knocked at the door. ‘Lina, Lina,’ cried she, ‘why do you hide yourself so? Come with me, and you shall see the most beautiful things in the world.’ Then the old woman wept, but the Snow Queen said: ‘There, I have frozen her heart, and she will never care for you again.’ So she took poor Lina away with her, and they flew over the sea in a sled drawn by reindeer, till they came to the Palace of the Snow Queen.

There were countless rooms in the palace, all full of the most wonderful things; but Lina felt very sad, and knew that she should never be happy again.

Once the Snow Queen said: ‘Lina, will you go with me and look at the world as it lies beneath the sea?’ Then she took her by the hand, and they went out on the sea-ice, and the Snow Queen clapped her hands, and all the sea was cleared away, and they could look down and see the fish swimming about in the red coral groves. But Lina felt very sad, and the Snow Queen said: ‘There, I have frozen her heart, and she will never care for you again.’

Another time the Snow Queen said: ‘Lina, will you go with me and see how the stars are made?’ Then she took her by the hand, and they went out upon the sea-ice, and the Snow Queen clapped her hands, and all the stars came sailing down in the sky, and they might have caught them and kept them, if they liked. But Lina felt very sad, and the Snow Queen said: ‘There, I have frozen her heart, and she will never care for you again.’

And so it went on; they went to the sun and the moon, and looked at the earth from afar; they saw the birds in the air, and the animals upon it, and the fishes in the sea; but Lina felt very sad, and the Snow Queen said: ‘There, I have frozen her heart, and she will never care for you again.’

At last the Snow Queen said: ‘Lina, will you go with me and see how people are made?’ Then she took her by the hand, and they went out upon the sea-ice, and the Snow Queen clapped her hands, and all the good and bad people in the world began to come together, and stood before them in a great crowd. The Snow Queen said: ‘Lina, shall we take the good people, and make them into palaces and churches, and make the world beautiful with them?’ ‘No,’ said Lina, ‘that would not be right; for good people are the best adornment for the world.’ Then the Snow Queen took the bad people, and clapped her hands, and they were all stuffed into a needle, and then the needle was thrown into the sea. ‘There,’ said she, ‘I have taken away all the wickedness from the world; and now, Lina, your heart is quite frozen, and you will never care for anyone.’

But Lina wept, and said: ‘Alas! what will become of me?’ ‘You shall be queen here,’ said the Snow Queen, ‘and rule over soft snowflakes, and dance with me round the moon.’

Then the Snow Queen clapped her hands, and a great crowd of snowflakes came flying in the air, and one of them said: ‘Who is the most beautiful here?’ ‘I am,’ said another. ‘No, I am,’ said a third. ‘Let us have a trial, and decide the matter between us,’ said the Snow Queen; ‘the most beautiful of us shall be queen, and Lina shall be second, and shall be queen of the stars.’ Then they began to dance and twirl round in the air; and Lina felt very sad, and thought: ‘I know very well that the Snow Queen will be queen over the snowflakes, for she is so much more beautiful than I am.’

But the stars danced down from the sky, and the first star that came was the Morning Star; then came the Evening Star; and they danced in among the snowflakes, and the Morning Star said: ‘Who is the most beautiful here?’ ‘I am,’ said one. ‘No, I am,’ said another. ‘Let us have a trial, and decide the matter between us,’ said the Morning Star; ‘the most beautiful of us shall be queen of the heavens, and shall ride in the chariot of the sun.’ Then they began to dance and twirl round in the air; and the Snow Queen felt very sad, and thought: ‘I know very well that the Morning Star will be queen of the heavens, for she is so much more beautiful than I am.’

And the Morning Star said: ‘Who is the most beautiful here?’ Then the Evening Star said: ‘That I certainly am not.’

‘And I am not either,’ said the stars that dance in the daytime.

‘And I am not either,’ said the stars that shine in the night-time.

‘And I am not either,’ said the comet.

‘And I am not either,’ said the meteor.

‘And I am not either,’ said the falling-star.

‘And I am not either,’ said the Milky Way.

‘And I am not either,’ said the Aurora Borealis.

‘And I am not either,’ said the Aurora Australis.

‘And I am not either,’ said the North Star.

‘And I am not either,’ said the Little Bear.

‘And I am not either,’ said the Great Bear.

‘And I am not either,’ said the Pleiades.

‘And I am not either,’ said the Seven Brothers.

‘And I am not either,’ said the Twins.

‘And I am not either,’ said the Hunter.

‘And I am not either,’ said the Chariot of the Sun.

‘And I am not either,’ said the Moon.

Then the Morning Star said: ‘I am the most beautiful of all, and therefore shall be queen of the heavens, and ride in the chariot of the sun.’ And the Evening Star said: ‘I am the most beautiful, and shall be queen of the heavens, and ride in the chariot of the sun.’ And the Morning Star said: ‘Let us have a trial, and decide the matter between us.’

Then the Morning Star went and rode in the chariot of the sun for a whole day; and the Evening Star went and rode in it for a whole day; and the Morning Star said: ‘Look, my stars, how beautiful I look in the chariot of the sun!’ ‘Yes,’ they said, ‘you look very beautiful.’ Then the Evening Star came and said: ‘Look, my stars, how beautiful I look in the chariot of the sun!’ ‘Yes,’ they said, ‘you look very beautiful.’

And the Morning Star said: ‘I will ride in the chariot of the sun for a whole year, and then my beauty will be still more"

","There was once a poor old woman who had two daughters, one beautiful and good, and one ugly and wicked. The old woman loved her eldest daughter very much, but the wicked girl was very ungrateful, and scorned her mother because she was so poor, and said she would have nothing to do with her any more. So the old woman left her to shift for herself, and took her eldest daughter into her house, and loved her, and cherished her, and she helped her mother in all her work.

It happened that some rich visitors came to the country, and the old woman heard that they were in search of a girl to be a chambermaid. She at once sent her eldest daughter to them, but the wicked girl heard of it, and envied her sister so much that she slipped behind her, and ran as fast as she could to the place where the visitors were, and got there first, and said she was the eldest daughter. The visitors did not know any better, and took her into their service, and she thought now she should have a good time, and be very happy. But her mistress did not keep her long. She was very silly and clumsy, and spoiled everything she touched, and the servants laughed at her behind her back, and she did not know it.

Her sister, in the meantime, stayed at home with her mother, and helped her in all her work, and was very kind and good to her. And one day as they were sitting together by the fire, the old woman said, ‘I should like to see my other daughter once again, she was so pretty and so well behaved.’ Then the other said, ‘If it please you, I will go and bring her, for she must be very sorry and unhappy to be left alone with no one to take care of her.’ ‘No, no,’ said the old woman, ‘that would be impossible; she has left me quite alone, and I can never repay such kindness. She knows very well how poor we are, and yet she has forsaken us, and I would not on any account go and trouble her.’

But her daughter said, ‘I will go and find her, and if she will not come back with me, I will at any rate take a message to her.’ ‘Well,’ said the old woman, ‘if it please you, go, but take care of yourself.’

Then the good girl put on her bonnet, and took a loaf of bread in her bag, and set out on the road in search of her sister. It was a long way, and the road was very bad, and she had to walk a long way before she came to the town where her sister lived. And as she was very hungry, she took out the loaf of bread, and cut herself a slice, but it was all spoiled, and turned sour in her mouth. Then she said, ‘Alas! alas! what shall I do? I cannot go back, and I cannot go on; my sister will think I have run away, and forgotten all about her.’

While she was thinking what to do, a little dwarf came up to her, and said, ‘Why are you so sad?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘I am very hungry, and my bread is sour, and I do not know what to do.’ Then the little dwarf took pity on her, and said, ‘I will give you a piece of bread that will taste sweet to you, though it be as sour as vinegar to other people.’ So he gave her a small piece of bread, and she ate it, and it seemed to her as if she had never tasted anything so sweet and dainty in all her life. Then she thanked the little dwarf very much, and said, ‘I cannot give you anything in return, for I have nothing but this old knife.’ And she gave him her knife, which was not of any use to her, for it had one side straight, and the other wavy.

The little dwarf said, ‘That is a very odd knife, but as you seem so grateful, I will give you three wishes; you may choose whatever you like.’ Then the good girl thought for a while, and said, ‘I like everything well enough, but I do not know what to wish for; I will take care not to use up all my wishes at once.’ So she thanked the little dwarf, and said she would think about it, and then went on her way.

She walked on till it became dark, and then she saw a large castle in the distance, and she thought she would rest there for the night. So she knocked at the door, and a servant came and said, ‘What are you seeking?’ ‘I seek a night’s lodging,’ said she. ‘It is late, and I am very tired.’ Then the servant said, ‘My mistress will not be at all pleased to see you, for she does not like to have any one stay in the castle at night.’ ‘If that be the case,’ said the girl, ‘I will go away again; but do tell me where I can find a night’s lodging.’ ‘You had better go to the mill,’ said the servant; ‘the miller will be very glad to have you.’

Then the girl went to the mill, and the miller said, ‘O that you had come half an hour earlier! for I was just going to light up the oven, and then you should have had some good bread to eat.’ So she stayed with the miller all night, and in the morning he gave her some beautiful sweet bread, for the bread that she had brought with her had all been spoiled.

Then she set out on her way again, and in the afternoon she came to the town where her sister lived. And the little dwarf came to meet her, and said, ‘I see you want to go into that town, so I will go with you.’ Then he took her by the hand, and they went into the town together.

The wicked girl was just then standing in the street, and when she saw her sister she looked very much surprised, and said, ‘Where have you sprung from? I thought you had run away, and had forgotten all about me.’ ‘No,’ said the other; ‘I have had a very long walk, for I went to visit my mother, who lives a great way off.’ Then the servant came up, and said, ‘My mistress will be very glad to see you, for she has been looking for you a long while.’

When the wicked girl went in to her mistress, she thought to herself, ‘I will soon set my sister at work, and then she will get into trouble, and I shall laugh at her.’ So she said, ‘Mistress, may not I tell you what? I am very much tired; pray let my sister take my place, and I will go out and rest.’ But the mistress said, ‘No, no,’ that was not necessary; she could rest whenever she pleased.

However, the wicked girl was very insistent, and at last her mistress said, ‘Very well,’ if her sister would exchange places with her, she might do as she liked. Then the other said, ‘I don’t know how the business is managed; I never was chambermaid in my life.’ But her sister said, ‘I will help you all I can, and if you get into any trouble, I will take your place.’

So they exchanged places, and the wicked girl went out, and the other took her place. And the servant came up, and said, ‘My mistress wants her room swept out.’ Then the good girl got on her hands and knees, and began to sweep; but the bad one said, ‘How silly you are!’ and took the broom from her, and gave her a besom, which was so hard and brittle that it broke in two pieces as soon as she touched it. Then the good girl said, ‘I see I cannot sweep the room; what am I to do?’ ‘Why,’ said the bad one, ‘I will tell you what; take this dish, and go into the kitchen, and bring me some hot coals.’

So she took the dish, and went into the kitchen, and said, ‘The chambermaid sends you the dish"

","The Enchanted Ring

There was once a poor old woman who had only one hen left in the world,
on which she wholly lived. This hen at length put brood, and hatched out
five chicks. As the old woman was standing over the brood, and could not
easily get away, the youngest chick, without waiting to be called, ran
under her left arm, and the other four ran under her right. She was
thereupon forced to remain standing a while longer, and as she stood she
fell into a brook that ran near her house. She was in a fair way to be
drowned, but the five chicks cried so piteously that their mother came
running, and drew her out. When she had recovered from her fright, she
took care to build a bridge over the brook, that she might be able to go
thither whenever she wanted to look after her hen and chicks.

Some time after this, she went there, and took with her a cake and a
flask of wine. As she sat by her hen and chicks, enjoying her dinner,
she saw a gold ring lying in the grass, which glittered like fire. ‘What
can this be,’ said she, ‘and who can have left it here?’ Then she took
it up, and put it on her little finger, where it fitted so well that it
seemed as if it had been made for it.

She had not sat there long before she heard a gentle voice behind her
say:

 ‘Put your hand in your bosom!’

The old woman started so that she fell against a stone, but she answered
nothing, but put her hand in her bosom.

The voice then spoke again:

 ‘Take the ring off thy finger!’

But she was so fond of the ring that she did not venture to do it, and
answered nothing.

The fifth time that the old woman heard the voice, she plucked up her
courage, and took the ring off her finger, and put it in her pocket.
Then she turned round, but there was nothing to be seen.

She had, however, no peace the rest of the day, but heard a continual
whispering and buzzing in her ears. The next day she went to the brook
again, and sat down by her hen and chicks. The whispers and buzzing in
her ears soon began again, and she heard a soft voice that seemed to
come from the ring in her pocket, saying:

 ‘Lift up thy thumb!’

But the old woman did not venture to do it.

The third time that the voice spoke, and said:

 ‘Take the ring out of thy pocket!’

she was afraid, and took it out, but put it on her finger again as soon
as she had done this.

The old woman heard no more whispers or buzzing in her ears, but as she
was going home in the evening, the ring said:

 ‘Pick up the stone!’

and pointed to a stone lying in her path.

The old woman stooped down and picked up the stone, and when she did
so a dwarf appeared, that was so small that he could with great difficulty
fill the palm of her hand. He besought her, with many words, not to be
angry with him for having thus troubled her, and said: ‘I have been
forced to take up my abode in the stone, and have been near starving.
Have pity on me, and take me with you.’

The old woman was at first unwilling, but the dwarf said: ‘If you will
not take me in, I must go back to the stone, and my torment will soon be
so great that I shall be forced to cry out, and then everyone within a
mile of me will hear me.’

Then the old woman said: ‘Little as you are, you shall have room to
move about with me, for I like you very well.’

So she put the dwarf into her pocket, and took him home with her.

The next morning she took him out, and he was so much pleased with the
sun shining on him, and with the air he breathed, that he danced for joy,
and said: ‘I have not felt so well for a long time.’

The old woman took the dwarf with her wherever she went. He always
remained in her pocket, and came out in the evening to visit her. He
was, too, a very good friend to her, for he told her when she should have
good luck in her hen, and when she should not.

Once when she was going to make a broth for herself, her dwarf said to
her: ‘Wait a while, I hear people coming.’

So she waited until two men came by, who began to sit down under a tree
to rest. The old woman took her hen, and ran to then, and said: ‘I am
so hungry that I will give you a piece of roasted meat, if you will let
me have the bones.’

The men said: ‘We have no money to buy anything, but will willingly
give you our two fine young chickens for the roasted meat.’

The old woman said: ‘I will not part with my roasted meat for your
chickens,’ but the dwarf in her pocket whispered to her: ‘Take the
chickens.’

So she took them, and when she got home she gave them to her hen to
lodge, and they hatched out between them twenty-five chicks each.

The old woman now became very rich, for she sold the chickens and their
chicks to the countrypeople, and became the richest woman in the land.

But she thought to herself: ‘I will not stop here; I must go and try my
luck in a strange country,’ and she took with her the dwarf, who always
remained in her pocket.

They travelled on and on, until at last they came to a great city, and
there was a palace in the middle of it, that shone like the sun. ‘This
must be the royal palace,’ said the old woman to the dwarf, ‘and here
must we try and get in.’

The dwarf said: ‘Wait a while, I hear people coming.’

So they waited until the queen came out to take the air. ‘Now,’ said
the dwarf, ‘go up to her, and pinch her in the leg.’

The old woman went up to the queen, and as the dwarf had told her, she
pinched her in the leg, so that she screamed out.

The king came running to see what was the matter, and wanted to know
what had happened. The queen was obliged to tell him that an old woman
had pinched her, and he said: ‘I will give the old offender up to justice,
if she can be caught.’

The old woman and the dwarf went into a narrow lane to hide themselves,
but the king’s guards were ordered to seize her on the spot, and take
her before the king.

When she was before the king, he asked her if she had pinched the queen,
and she said: ‘Yes, your majesty, and if it had not been for that, your
majesty’s wife would soon have been dead.’

‘What do you mean by that?’ said the king. ‘You shall have nothing
but death for your pains.’

The dwarf in the old woman’s pocket now whispered to her: ‘Tell a tale,
and say that you are a famous witch, and that you can change yourself
into all sorts of shapes.’

Then the old woman began her tale, and said: ‘Your majesty, I am a
wonderful witch, and can change myself into all sorts of shapes. I can
change myself into a bird, and fly round the sun; I can change myself
into a fish, and swim in the"

","There was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter, and as she was
growing up she became very beautiful indeed; and when she was fully grown
the miller said, ‘I will give her to the man who can do the most for
her.’ Now a king’s son came and boasted that he could do much for her,
and he was followed by a poor soldier, who said modestly that he could
do very little. But the miller said, ‘Neither words nor promises: show
us what you can do.’ Then the king’s son said, ‘I will set her in the
highest window of the castle, so that she may be seen from afar.’ And the
soldier said, ‘I will give her a roast chicken every day.’ When the king’s
son had said this, he rode away; but the soldier stayed on, and every
day he brought a fowl which he roasted, and served it up to the miller
and his daughter. And thus for a long time the two were very happy
together.

But at last the soldier said, ‘I must have some sign of our union, so
I have asked a next of mine to come and cut a piece of wood out of his
house for me.’ Now the soldier was a tailor, and his friend who came was
his wife, who had cut a rafter out of their house. And she brought with
her a little child, which she said was her nephew, but was really her
daughter. And she besought the soldier to take her in, as she was a
poor woman, and had nobody in the world to help her. Then the soldier
took her into his house, and said to the miller’s daughter, ‘This is my
mother, and this is my little brother.’

After a while the soldier said to the miller, ‘I have served you long
enough; now I want you to say when I am to take my wife home.’ And the
miller answered, ‘You must take her home directly.’ But the soldier said
to his wife, ‘Be careful and see to it that we take away with us all
our furniture.’ Then the miller’s daughter went to her room to get
her things ready for her journey, and when she opened her trunk the
little girl ran in and took it away. But the girl saw a looking-glass
in which she knew her mother wanted to look, so she ran with it out of
the trunk and kept it for herself. The next day the soldier came to take
his wife away, and as they were going out the miller said, ‘I am now
going to judge: you have won my daughter, and you must do as I tell you.
You must take her with you on the same donkey which you rode when you
came here.’ Now the soldier was a strong man, and he got on first, and
his wife mounted behind him, and the little girl got on behind her
mother, and they all rode off on one donkey.

When they got to the soldier’s house the wife said, ‘I am very tired;
I must lie down and rest a while.’ So she went into the room where the
looking-glass was, and said to the child, ‘Take me up that looking-glass,
I want to look in it.’ Then the little girl took the looking-glass in
her hands, and held it before her mother’s face, and as she did so she
wished her mother and herself away, and in a moment they both vanished,
and only the little girl remained. And the soldier said, ‘I am now
master of the house, and you are my daughter.’ And from that time
forth he had a merry little wife, who was always singing and dancing,
and everybody said, ‘Blessed be the day which brought her to us!’ And
the miller’s daughter went home to her father, and they lived happily
together until the miller died, and then she went back to the soldier,
and they lived happily together all the rest of their days.

","The Wolf and the Seven Little Kids

In a dark forest dwelt a wolf who was very much respected by all the beasts,
because he was the eldest and wisest of the woods. Now it came to pass that
this wolf had seven little kids, who played about the forest and were very
merrily off, but they were very, very naughty. They tore up the old men’s
beards, and pulled the old women’s hair, and pinched the little children
when they could catch them, and did a great many other mischievous things.

At last the wolf called them all before him and said, ‘You must either
become good, or I will eat you up every one.’ But they were not at all
frightened, and said they would run away and never come back to their
father any more. Then the wolf let them go, and thought no more about
them, for a long while.

One day as he was walking by himself in the forest, he heard a most piteous
crying, and he followed the noise, and it seemed to come from a thick
bush. When he got there he found a little lamb lying on the ground, with
its legs and tail bound fast together, and the shepherd’s dog standing
close by it, barking and making a great noise. ‘You wicked beast,’ said the
wolf, ‘what have you done?’ ‘Hark ye,’ said the dog, ‘the lamb was so
naughty, and butted my master with its horns, so I have bound it and will
run and fetch the shepherd, and he will know what to do with it.’

Just then came the shepherd in sight, and the wolf said, ‘Pray, good man,
what will become of your lamb?’ ‘Oh!’ said he, ‘it is lost; it must be killed,
for it has been so bad and vicious that it has butted my little boy, and
butted my girl, and butteted all about the place, till I could not keep
it any longer: so I have made up my mind to kill it directly.’ ‘Lord have
mercy on you,’ said the wolf, ‘and spare its life; I will take it with me
into the forest, and it shall be as safe there as a king in his palace.’
The shepherd saw that the wolf was very fond of the lamb, and would take
care of it, so he said he would not kill it, but would willingly give it
to the wolf to keep. Then the wolf took it up in his mouth, and went away
with it into the forest, and the little lamb soon became quite at home
there, and ran about with the seven little kids, and butted all the old
beasts about the forest, and was as merry as could be.

One day the wolf said to the little lamb, ‘Your master the shepherd has
made a hole in your right ear with his club for butting people; pray take
care not to butt anybody, or else he will come and take you away, and I
shall be very sorry to lose you.’ ‘Don’t worry yourself about that,’
said the little lamb; ‘I’ll take care not to butt anybody.’

Another day the wolf called the little lamb aside, and said, ‘Your master
the shepherd has made a hole in your left ear with his staff for butting
people; pray take care not to butt anybody, or else he will come and take
you away, and I shall be very sorry to lose you.’ ‘Don’t worry yourself
about that,’ said the little lamb; ‘I’ll take care not to butt anybody.’

But one day, when the wolf was away, up came a little goat, and the little
lamb, that could not help itself, gave it a butt in the side with its
horn, and said, ‘There, you are fat and sleek, and can take it.’ Then the
goat said, ‘You rogue, you have butted me, and I’ll tell my master, and he
will not let you live in the forest any longer.’ Then the little lamb was
very much frightened, and said, ‘Alas! what shall I do?’ So the goat ran
away, and soon came up to the old goat. ‘Guess who I have in my mouth,’
said the little goat. ‘What? The little lamb?’ said the old goat. ‘Yes,
that’s right,’ said the little goat. ‘Well, he’s had the cheek to butt
me.’ Then the old goat said, ‘I’ll soon take him away from you; he’s no
fit to live in the forest.’ So the old goat went with the little goat to
the wolf, and said, ‘Dear Mr Wolf, that bad little lamb of yours has been
butting my little goat, and I’m sure he’ll be doing other people a bad
turn some day or other; pray take him away.’ ‘Where are you, little lamb?’
said the wolf. ‘Here I am,’ answered the little lamb. ‘How can you be so
naughty?’ said the wolf. ‘I’m not naughty,’ said the little lamb. ‘Yes,
you are,’ said the wolf, ‘and you shall die for it.’ Then he ate up the
little lamb, and the old goat went away.

A short time after, the wolf called one of his kids to him, and said, ‘My
little kid, you are very pretty, and I’m sure you’ll be a fine sheep some
day; but you must take care you don’t run about the forest and butt
everybody, or I shall be forced to eat you up.’ ‘Don’t worry yourself
about that,’ said the little kid; ‘I’ll take care not to butt anybody.’

Another day the wolf called the little kid aside, and said, ‘Your master
the shepherd has made a hole in your right ear with his club for butting
people; pray take care not to butt anybody, or else he will come and take
you away, and I shall be very sorry to lose you.’ ‘Don’t worry yourself
about that,’ said the little kid; ‘I’ll take care not to butt anybody.’

But one day, when the wolf was away, up came a little calf, and the little
kid, that could not help itself, gave it a butt in the side with its
horn, and said, ‘There, you are fat and sleek, and can take it.’ Then the
calf said, ‘You rogue, you have butted me, and I’ll tell my master, and he
will not let you live in the forest any longer.’ Then the little kid was
very much frightened, and said, ‘Alas! what shall I do?’ So the calf ran
away, and soon came up to the old bull. ‘Guess who I have in my mouth,’
said the calf. ‘What? The little kid?’ said the old bull. ‘Yes, that’s
right,’ said the calf. ‘Well he’s had the cheek to butt me.’ Then the old
bull said, ‘I’ll soon take him away from you; he’s no fit to live in the
forest.’ So the old bull went with the calf to the wolf, and said, ‘Dear
Mr Wolf, that bad little kid of yours has been butting my little calf,
and I’m sure he’ll be doing other people a bad turn some day or other;
pray take him away.’ ‘Where are you, my kid?’ said the wolf. ‘Here I am,
sir,’ answered the little kid. ‘How can you be so naughty?’ said the wolf.
‘I’m not naughty,’ said the little kid. ‘Yes,"

","Once upon a time, there was a poor woodcutter who lived with his wife and two children in a little cottage at the edge of a great forest. They had nothing to live upon but one loaf of bread, and one glass of milk a day. Sometimes when there was no work to be done in the forest, the man would go there with his little axe to cut fuel, that he might at least have a fire in the evening; and his wife would say to him, ‘Be careful that you do not stay too late, for I am uneasy when you are gone.’ But he always answered, ‘Don’t worry, I’ll be back long before night.’

One day, as he was going through the forest, he heard a strange noise, as if someone was crying for mercy. He listened, and heard it again; so he left his axe and went to see what was happening. When he came to the spot, he saw a little old woman, with a very high, pointed hat, sitting on a mossy stone, and her face was all covered with blood. ‘Good woman,’ said the woodcutter, ‘what has happened to you?’ ‘Ah,’ answered she, ‘I have been out walking in the forest, and the branches of a tree caught me and scratched my face; carry me home with you, and I will be grateful to you for all you can do for me.’ The woodcutter lifted her up, and carried her home to his wife, who at first was afraid of the blood-stained face, but at last took pity on her, and allowed her to lie upon the bed. Then the woodcutter fetched some white cloths, and bound up her face, and she said to him, ‘Little as you are, you have a strong arm, and are good and kind-hearted; if you will do anything that I ask you to do, I will be your friend, and will grant you three wishes.

The woodcutter said, ‘I will think of that.’ Then his wife gave the little old woman something to eat and drink, and she ate and drank, and very soon began to recover strength.

When it was dark, the woodcutter and his wife went to bed; but he forgot all about the three wishes, and lay awake a long time thinking of his troubles. At last he got up, and went to the little old woman, and said, ‘I have thought of what you said; you shall be my friend, and grant me three wishes.’ ‘Very well,’ said she; ‘what are they to be?’ ‘First,’ said the woodcutter, ‘I wish that I may always have plenty of food for my wife and children.’ ‘Your wish is granted,’ said the old woman.

Then the woodcutter went back to bed, but he lay awake a long time thinking; at last he got up again, and went to the little old woman, and said, ‘I have thought of another wish; I wish that I may always have plenty of money.’ ‘Your wish is granted,’ said the old woman.

Again the woodcutter went to bed, but he lay awake all night thinking; at last, just as the first cock crowed, he got up and went to the little old woman, and said, ‘I have thought of my third wish; I wish that you would take me to the fairies’ feast.’ ‘That is no easy thing to do,’ said the old woman; ‘the fairies are very angry with you for cutting down their tree, and they want to take your life.’ Then the woodcutter begged so hard for it, that the old woman at last said, ‘I will do what you wish, but you must be careful and do nothing wrong, or you will be in danger.’

The next morning, as the woodcutter was going out, the little old woman gave him a cloak that would make him invisible, and said, ‘Put it on when you go to the feast.’

Then the woodcutter went straight to the fairies’ feast; and when he got there, the fairies were sitting in a ring, dancing and singing:

 ‘Round and round the ring goes merrily,
  Ring the living rosary!
  Here’s a health to the fairies’ glee,
  Ring the living rosary!’

And as they sang and danced, they threw down nuts and apples, and all sorts of sweet things; and now and then a fairy would throw a gold piece into the ring.

The woodcutter stood still and watched them; and when they had been dancing a while, they took a walk in the wood, and left a fairy sitting in the ring. Then the woodcutter put on his cloak, and took the fairy’s place in the ring, and the fairies came back and took him for the fairy, and danced and sang as before, and threw down nuts and apples, and all sorts of sweet things; and now and then a fairy would throw a gold piece into the ring.

So the woodcutter gathered together a great many nuts and apples, and a large sum of money; and when the fairies came back, they took him for the fairy, and did not know him, and took him with them into the wood. Then he followed them, and listened to all their secrets; and they told him how they got their power of enchanting men and women, so that they did what the fairies wished, and how they could make themselves invisible, and could take any form they pleased.

When he had learned all this, he was still not satisfied; so he stayed till they came to a great lake, in the midst of which there was an island, and on the island stood a palace of gold and crystal. ‘That is the fairies’ palace,’ said they to him; ‘and there live the king and queen of the fairies.’ Then he wished himself at home; and when he awoke, he found that it was all a dream.

However, when he went to the forest to cut fuel, there lay a great pile of nuts and apples at his feet; and when he went home in the evening, there were a heap of gold in the corner of the room. And so, from that time forward, there was plenty of money for the woodcutter and his wife and children.

Then the woodcutter built a large house, and the old woman went to live there with him; and she told him that he had one more wish, and that he might wish for anything in the world. At first he did not know what to wish for; then he thought of his old mother, who was very poor and unhappy, and he wished that she might be rich and happy. Then the old woman said, ‘Your mother is already rich and happy; go and see for yourself.’

So the woodcutter went to his mother’s house, and there he really found his mother rich and happy; for on one side of her stood a heap of gold as large as a calf, and on the other side a pile of nuts and apples almost as large; and around her stood all her old friends, feasting and making merry.

Then the woodcutter was very glad, and he stayed and feasted with them; and when he was going away, his mother begged him to stay and be her companion; but he said, ‘I cannot stay, for I have a wife and children.’ ‘Then at least do this,’ said his mother; ‘stay with me for three days and nights.’ But the woodcutter said, ‘I cannot do even that; for I must earn my living.’ ‘Then do this,’ said his mother; ‘take this sack of gold, and lay it by your mother’s side in the bed, and then you will have done all I ask you.’

So the woodcutter took the sack of gold and laid it by his mother’s side in the bed; and when he wanted to go away, he pushed the old woman, that she should get up; but the sack of gold rolled away, and the old woman fell down dead. Then he was very sorry, and went to his wife and children, and lived happily to the end of his days.

","Once upon a time, there was a poor old woman who lived in a hut on the outskirts of a village. She gathered fuel for herself in the forest, and one day as she was gathering wood, she found a little child, half-dead, and scarcely breathing. She took pity on it, and carried it home with her, and took care of it, and nursed it, and it soon became well. ‘Poor little thing,’ said she, ‘who hath abandoned thee in the forest, and how shall I dispose of thee?’ She thought a while, and then said, ‘I will take thee to the mill, and give thee to the miller’s wife, who will take care of thee.’ So she took the child and carried it to the mill, and gave it to the miller’s wife, who had long wished for a child, and said she would take good care of it.

The old woman went her way, thankful in her heart that she had saved the child’s life. The miller’s wife loved the child dearly, and took great care of it, and it grew strong and healthy, and was as happy as a child could be in so poor a house.

One day the miller said to his wife, ‘Let the child have something to ride upon, that it may have some pleasure.’ So the wife made a little sledge for the child to ride upon, and it was very pleased with it, and whenever the miller went out, or the miller’s wife went to the village, the child took its little sledge and went with them.

Now this sledge had a very strange fate. Wherever the child took it, it was sure to meet with some mishap; the sledge would either overset, or the child would fall off, or the wheels would come off, or the axle-tree would break, or the sledge would catch in a hole and drag the poor child along upon the ground. Nothing would do but the sledge was bewitched. Then the miller and his wife were very sad, for they did not know what to do, and they were afraid to let the child go out at all.

Meanwhile the child grew bigger, and began to run about by itself, and one day the miller said to his wife, ‘The child is big enough to help me in the mill; he can run the wheel, and set the sacks upon the donkey, and bring the meal down from the loft; so let us try him.’ The wife agreed, and the next morning the child went with the miller to the mill.

The mill was situated in a wood, and the day was warm, so the child said to the miller, ‘It is very warm, I am sure, let the windows be opened.’ But the miller said, ‘The wind might blow the cinders into the fire, and put it out, so we had better not open the windows.’ However, the child again said, ‘It is very warm, I am sure, let the windows be opened, or else I shall be choked.’ Then the miller said angrily, ‘Do you think you are the only one who is to work in the mill? Do you think nobody was here before you? Go up to the loft and fetch the meal, and stop your chattering.’

So the child went up to the loft and brought the meal down, but as he was going up he looked through a crack in the ladder and saw a little grey old man sitting in the corner. ‘Bless me!’ said he, ‘what a funny little man! I’m so glad I’ve seen him!’ and he clapped his hands for joy. But the little grey man fumed and blew, and said, ‘Unwise child! why hast thou awakened me? Thou shalt suffer for it.’ Then the child came back with the meal, and the miller said, ‘Why so long? Have you not brought the meal down?’ ‘Yes,’ said the child, ‘and I have seen a funny little man up in the corner.’ But the miller said, ‘Thou art a silly child, to sit chattering with every tomfool that comes into thine head; go and see to the donkey, and bring him down some more meal.’

So the child went and brought the donkey down, and as he was going back the little grey man called to him, and said, ‘Take some of the meal, and throw it full in the mill.’ Then the child did so, and the mill would not work. ‘Thou art right in that also,’ said the little grey man; ‘the mill will not work, and thou shalt have no rest until I am satisfied.’ Then the child went back to the miller, and said, ‘The donkey will not stay, he wants to go home.’ ‘Thou silly child,’ said the miller, ‘how can the donkey go home, when he has had nothing to eat? Go and fetch him some more meal.’

So the child went and took the meal to the donkey, and as he was going back the little grey man said, ‘Take some more meal, and throw it into the mill.’ Then the child did so, and the mill worked with such a noise and whirl that the donkey was frightened, and ran away, and the meal was scattered about. ‘Thou art right in that also,’ said the little grey man; ‘the donkey has run away, and thou shalt have no rest until I am satisfied.’ Then the child went back to the miller, and said, ‘My lord miller, the donkey has run away, and the meal is scattered about.’ ‘Thou silly child,’ said the miller, ‘what wilt thou not do to vex me? Go and bring the donkey back, and make the meal up, and then go up to the loft again, and fetch me some more meal.’

So the child went and brought the donkey back, and made the meal up, and then went up to the loft again for more meal. ‘Stay,’ said the little grey man, ‘take some more meal, and throw it into the mill.’ Then the child did so, and the mill worked with such a noise and whirl that all the meal was scattered about, and the donkey ran away, and the child after it. ‘Thou art right in that also,’ said the little grey man; ‘the donkey has run away, and thou shalt have no rest until I am satisfied.’

Then the little grey man went up to the miller, and complained to him that the child had set all his house in order, and had scattered all his meal about, and had run away with his donkey, and had lost all his livelihood. ‘Thou art a very unlucky child,’ said the miller; ‘go out into the wood, and lament and bewail thy fate, and I will give thee a loaf of bread and a piece of cheese, that thou mayst live upon it.’ So the child went out and ate the bread and cheese, and then the little grey man came to him, and said, ‘Why dost thou stay there? Go out farther into the wood, and lament and bewail thy fate, and I will give thee a loaf of bread and a piece of cheese, that thou mayst live upon it.’ Then the child went on, and ate the bread and cheese, and the little grey man came to him again, and said, ‘Why dost thou stay there? Go still farther into the wood, and lament and bewail thy fate, and I will give thee a loaf of bread and a piece of cheese, that thou mayst live upon it.’ So the child went on, and ate the bread and cheese, and the little grey man came to him again, and said, ‘Why dost thou stay there? Go still farther into the wood, and lament and bewail thy fate, and I will give thee a loaf of bread and a piece of cheese, that thou mayst live upon it.’ Then the child said, ‘I will stay no longer, I will do all thou biddest, only promise me one thing--that thou wilt tell me why it is that I have this bad luck.’"

","There was once a poor woodman, who cut wood in the forest, and lived in a
cottage with his wife. One evening, as he was sitting by the fire, smoking a
pipe, and looking thoughtfully into the flames, his wife said, ‘What are
you thinking about, dear husband?’ ‘I am thinking,’ said he, ‘how we will
live from henceforth, for I have cut all the wood in the forest.’ ‘Then we
must work together,’ said the wife, ‘and earn our livelihood in some way
or other.’

The next morning the man rose early, and went into the forest to cut
down a tree, and the woman gathered together all the rings and brooches she
had, and went into the town to dispose of them. She walked the whole day
from shop to shop, but could dispose of nothing, and returned home in the
evening very much grieved and disheartened. ‘Alas! dear husband,’ said she,
‘no one would buy even one of my rings or brooches; I have not earned so
many penn’orth to buy bread with.’ ‘Never mind,’ said the man, ‘I have
cut down a fine large tree, and have made two shillings by it.’ ‘Two
shillings!’ cried the wife, ‘I have not earned even half a farthing.’

The next day the man went further into the forest to cut down a tree,
and the woman rose early, and took with her all her jewels, and went to a
town many miles off. She walked the whole day from shop to shop, but could
sell nothing, and came home in the evening very much grieved and tired.
‘Alas! dear husband,’ said she, ‘no one would buy even one of my jewels;
I have not sold one farthing’s worth.’ ‘Never mind,’ said the man, ‘I have
made four shillings this day.’ ‘Four shillings!’ cried the wife, ‘I have
not sold a farthing’s worth.’

The third day the man cut down a very large tree, and the woman took all
her jewels to a great city, and walked the whole day from shop to shop, but
could sell nothing, and came home in the evening very much tired and
disheartened. ‘Alas! dear husband,’ said she, ‘no one would buy even one of
my jewels; I have not sold so much as a farthing’s worth.’ ‘Never mind,’
said the man, ‘I have made six shillings this day.’ ‘Six shillings!’ cried
the wife, ‘I have not sold so much as a farthing.’

The fourth day the man felled a large tree, and the woman took all her
jewels to a town many miles off, and walked the whole day from shop to
shop, but could sell nothing, and came home in the evening very much tired
and grieved. ‘Alas! dear husband,’ said she, ‘no one would buy even one of
my jewels; I have not sold so much as a farthing’s worth.’ ‘Never mind,’
said the man, ‘I have made eight shillings this day.’ ‘Eight shillings!’
cried the wife, ‘I have not sold so much as a farthing.’

The fifth day the man felled a very large tree, and the woman took all
her jewels to a great city, and walked the whole day from shop to shop, but
could sell nothing, and came home in the evening very much tired and
grieved. ‘Alas! dear husband,’ said she, ‘no one would buy even one of my
jewels; I have not sold so much as a farthing’s worth.’ ‘Never mind,’ said
the man, ‘I have made ten shillings this day.’ ‘Ten shillings!’ cried the
wife, ‘I have not sold so much as a farthing.’

The sixth day the man felled a very large tree, and the woman took all
her jewels to the capital of the kingdom, and walked the whole day from
shop to shop, but could sell nothing, and came home in the evening very much
tired and grieved. ‘Alas! dear husband,’ said she, ‘no one would buy even
one of my jewels; I have not sold so much as a farthing’s worth.’ ‘Never
mind,’ said the man, ‘I have made twelve shillings this day.’ ‘Twelve
shillings!’ cried the wife, ‘I have not sold so much as a farthing.’

The seventh day the man felled a very large tree, and the woman sat
down in a corner and wept, for she saw very well that no one would buy her
jewels, and yet she had none other means of earning a livelihood. In the
evening, as she sat thus weeping, there was a knocking at the door, and a
little dwarf came in, and said, ‘Why do you weep, dear child?’ ‘Alas!’
said the woman, ‘what can I do to earn my livelihood? I have tried all I
could, and yet have not been able to sell even one of my jewels.’ ‘What
do you call that box which stands in the corner?’ said the dwarf. ‘Ah!
dear sir,’ said the woman, ‘that is full of my jewels.’ ‘Then take them
all out, and bring me what you have there.’ As the woman took out one
jewel after another, the little dwarf paid her a shilling for every one,
and at last paid her all down in money. ‘I have now all my money again,’
said the dwarf, ‘and I will give you an excellent piece of advice. Sell
no more of your jewels, but take that money, and buy with it two fine
heifers, and every morning when your husband goes into the forest to cut
down trees, you go with him, and in the evening when he comes back, give
the heifers drink out of the bottle which stands in the corner, and out of
every bottle which is empty, fill it up with the cow’s milk, and next day
sell the milk. I warrant you that in a month’s time you will have as much
money as will buy a cow, and the cow will give you as much milk as you
can use, and more than you can sell.’

The woman did as the dwarf advised, and in a month she had not only as
much money as would buy a cow, but had also milk enough for her own use.
The little dwarf then came again, and said, ‘Now, as you have got a cow,
give the heifers away, and take care not to sell the cow, but keep it,
and every morning when your husband goes into the forest to cut down
trees, go with him, and in the evening when he comes back, give the cow
drink out of the bottle which stands in the corner, and out of every bottle
which is empty, fill it up with the cow’s milk, and next day sell the milk.
I warrant you that in two months’ time you will have as much money as will
buy two cows, and the two cows will give you as much milk as you can use,
and more than you can sell.’

The woman did as the dwarf advised, and in two months she had not only
as much money as would buy two cows, but had also milk enough for her own
use. The little dwarf then came again, and said, ‘Now, as you have got
two cows, give the one away, and take care not to sell either of the cows,
but keep them, and every morning when your husband goes into the forest to
cut down trees, go with him, and in the evening when he comes back, give
the cows drink out of the bottle which stands in the corner, and"

","The Snow Queen

Once upon a time there was a good and kind old man, who had a beautiful
daughter called Gerda. This Gerda was so good and kind that the sun itself
seemed to shine out of her eyes when she looked upon the world with them,
and her heart was pure as the brightest day.

One day, when the snowflakes were dancing in the air, and the rooftops were
white, and the ground was covered deep with soft snow, Gerda and her little
brother, Käthe, were standing together in their pretty garden, and picking
flowers. Suddenly a sharp piece of ice cut Käthe’s eye, and a drop of blood
ran down. But the piece of ice was no common piece of ice: it was a splinter
from the window of the Snow Queen, who had flown over the world that morning,
and thrown the pieces of ice about like hail.

Käthe felt nothing at first, but when he went home and looked in the glass,
he saw with horror that one of his eyes was no longer like the other; it was
as hard and white as the Snow Queen’s palace, and sparkled like ice. Then
he screamed with fear and misery, and his mother came and looked at him,
and saw what had happened. She tried to comfort him, but it was of no use;
so she sent for Gerda, and said, ‘Go and find the Snow Queen, and pray her
to take Käthe to be her playfellow for ever, that he may be cured.’

Then Gerda kissed her brother, and said, ‘I will soon come back, Käthe;
be at ease, and take care of yourself, till I come.’

So Gerda took her brother’s hand, and looked at it for the last time; it
was still warm, but already she could feel that it was growing cold. Then she
went away, and her heart was very heavy, but still she was so full of love
to her brother that she did not once think of her own troubles.

She soon came to the great highway that leads over the whole world, and
there she saw a little man, who had been crushed by a cart, and lay on the
ground, and was quite yellow, and did not look very nice. ‘Do come and help
me up,’ said the little man; ‘my cart crushed me, and it hurts me to lie
here.’ ‘What a nasty dirty place,’ thought Gerda, as she sat down, and
took hold of the little man; ‘but he is in a way, so I must help him.’

So she lifted up the little man, and set him upon her knee, and soon
he was quite comfortable, and began to tell her all sorts of things.

‘See how the world looks from up here,’ said he; ‘how green the fields are,
and how blue the sky! I wish I had a nice juicy apple.’ Then he looked
round and saw a tree full of apples, and said, ‘I wish you would climb up
and throw me one.’

Gerda did not at first like this, for she thought, ‘What if I were to fall
down and break my neck?’ But the little man said, ‘Oh, don’t be silly;
you will be quite safe.’ So Gerda climbed up the tree, and picked a juicy
apple, and threw it down to the little man; but as she was sitting among
the branches, the wind blew so, that she could not get out again, but was
forced to sit and wait till someone came.

Meanwhile the little man was rolling the apple along the ground, and
looking up at Gerda, and at first he did not seem very sorry for her; but
when it began to grow dark, and she was still stuck fast, he called out,
‘What a silly girl you are!’ and began to cry, and was very sorry for her.

Then he went home to his mother, who lived in a house under the ground,
and begged her to help Gerda. The mother took pity on her, and gave her
son a knife, and said, ‘Cut a deep piece out of the seat of the chair, so
that when Gerda sits down upon it she will fall through into the earth, and
we will soon be able to help her.’

So the little man did as he was told, and took the chair, and sat by the
roadside, where Gerda could see it, and read the following words, painted
in golden letters:

 ‘Sit upon the chair, and you will fall
  Into the earth, and thence I may help thee best of all.’

Gerda read this, and trusted what was written; so she sat down, and at
once fell through the seat into the earth, and a trap-door sprang shut above
her. Then two little men came, and lifted her up, and carried her through
a long tunnel to the little man’s house. They gave her food and drink, and
when she had rested herself, they told her that they would take her to the
Snow Queen.

The little man’s mother came to see Gerda, and gave her a cloak that would
carry her through the air, and a sledge to sit upon, and a whip to drive
it. ‘Now, Gerda,’ said she, ‘drive on, and the wind will blow you along;
only take care not to lose the cloak, for if you do, you will fall to the
ground, and that would be very bad for you.’

Then the little man gave Gerda a piece of bread, and said, ‘Take this
bread, and throw crumbs now and then on to the ground, so that the little
bird, Lapp-Laddoo, may follow you, for he will sing and tell you a song,
that will help you to find the Snow Queen.’

So Gerda put on her cloak, and took her bread, and drove her sledge away
over the fields and woods, and the wind blew so strong that it was as if
it would blow the sledge along whether she whipped it or not. Sometimes
she threw a crumb of bread on the ground, and then Lapp-Laddoo came hopping
up, and sang:

 ‘Till the crumb is eaten,
  Till the crumb is gone,
  Tell me where the Snow Queen’s palace is situated,
  Tell me where it is sited,
  On the hill or in the valley,
  In the mountain’s cave or on the tree-top,
  In the briar-hedge or in the thorn-bush,
  In the red-stone castle or the granite rock.’

And then Gerda knew the song would help her, and she drove on, till at
last the bread was all gone, and Lapp-Laddoo flew away.

One day, as Gerda was driving along, looking about her, and thinking of
Käthe, and of her journey, and of everything at home, and of everything she
should see and do, till at last her mind became so troubled that she did
not know what she was about; and she did not drive or whip, but let the
sledge run on very fast. At last down it went, with a loud noise, into a
deep valley; and the cloak was all torn off, and Gerda sat upon the cold
sledge in the snow.

Then she was very much frightened, and began to cry; and the snow fell
fast, and covered her and the sledge so that she could not see a thing. And
there she sat for a long time, till she was quite tired, and could cry no
more.

At last, by good luck, a little old woman came by, who took Gerda up on
to her sledge, and covered her with a cloak, and took her to her cottage.
There she let her rest herself, and gave her food and drink, and asked
her what had happened.

","There was once a poor woodman, who cut wood in the forest, and lived in a
hut with his wife, and his two children. Now it came to pass that the wood
was all cut, and the man knew not how he should get any more to earn his
livelihood; so he said to his wife: ‘Alas, what shall we do? I cannot get
any work, and we shall have nothing to live upon.’ ‘Then, my husband,’
said she, ‘let us go into the forest, and cut a little more, though what
we get to sell may not be worth more than our trouble in carrying it
home.’ So the man said: ‘That will be better than doing nothing; let us
go therefore, and cut what little we can.’

Then the woman said: ‘I will tell you a good story by the way; it will pass
away pleasantly, and the time will seem very short.’ ‘Yes,’ said the man,
‘do tell a tale.’ ‘There was once a man,’ said she, ‘who had a faithful
friend, to whom he was very much attached, and who had often saved his
life; but this friend had a wife who was very ugly, and the man could not
bear to see his friend go home to her. One day, therefore, he said to him:
“I wish you would leave your wife, and be my friend alone.” “That is
impossible,” said the other; “my wife and I have made a pact together, and
we cannot break it.” The man was angry at this answer, and said: “If you
will not leave your wife, I shall no longer have anything to do with you.”
Then the friend begged so hard that he agreed to make the attempt he was
asked to make; but he said: “I cannot do what you wish without making a
great sacrifice, for I shall have to give up my only child, which I love
dearly.” “That is nothing,” said the other, “you will still have me for a
friend.” So the friend yielded to his entreaties, and left his wife; but he
was very unhappy, and soon went to visit her, and said: “I cannot live
alone; we will make up our minds to part from our child, and then we shall
be able to stay with each other.” The wife answered: “It would be a great
sacrifice for me to give up my child, but if my husband thinks it necessary,
I am willing to do it.” Then they went together to a strange land, where no
one knew them, and there they sought for a place where they could leave
their child to die; but they could not find any spot so dreadful and horrible
that they thought it would be a fit one. At last they came to a large
marsh, which was surrounded on all sides by high trees, and in the middle
there was a little island, full of beautiful flowers. There they thought
they should be quite sure of leaving the child in safety, for no one could
get there, on account of the deep mire that surrounded it. So they took
their child there, and laid it on the grass, and the mother went away with
a heavy heart, and the father followed her.

But the child was an handsome boy, and God sent two angels from heaven to
watch over him; and they took care that no hurt should come near him. The
birds built their nests around him, and the rabbits and hares came to him,
and played with him; the deer came and browsed by his side, and the roe and
the chamois came to drink to the water that ran round the island. And the
boy grew up, and knew nothing of the world, but was good and kind and
peaceful.

After some time the two angels went to him, and said: ‘Your time has come;
you must go forth into the world.’ Then the boy was sad, and did not wish
to leave the beautiful flowers and the animals that had been so kind to
him; but the angels took him by the hand, and led him away.

And now the woodman and his wife had made a pile of their wood, and were
going home with it on their shoulders, when the man said: ‘I will tell you
a fine story by the way.’ ‘Yes,’ said the woman, ‘do tell one.’ Then the
man began: ‘There was once a little boy who lived alone on a green island,
and the birds had built their nests around him, and the roe and the chamois
came to drink at the brook, and the deer came and browsed by his side.’
‘And did the little boy ever come back to his mother?’ asked the wife.
‘No,’ answered the man, ‘he grew up there, and two angels came, and took
him away, and led him into the wide world.’

When they came to the pile of wood, the man said to his wife: ‘We must
make two more trips, and carry home all the wood that we have cut.’ Then
they went back into the forest, and made the two trips, and carried all
the wood home upon their shoulders.

When they had rested themselves, the man said again: ‘I will tell you one
more tale by the way.’ ‘Yes,’ said the woman, ‘do tell one.’ Then the man
began: ‘There was once a little boy who lived alone on a green island, and
the birds had built their nests around him, and the roe and the chamois came
to drink at the brook, and the deer came and browsed by his side.’ ‘Did
the little boy ever go back to his mother?’ asked the woman. ‘No,’ said
the man, ‘he grew up there, and two angels came, and took him away, and
led him into the wide world.’

Then the wood was all sold, and with what they got for it they bought a
little cow; and the man said to his wife: ‘I will tell you a fine story
by the way.’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘do tell one.’ Then the man began: ‘There
was once a little boy who lived alone on a green island, and the birds had
built their nests around him, and the roe and the chamois came to drink at
the brook, and the deer came and browsed by his side.’ ‘Did the little boy
ever go back to his mother?’ asked the woman. ‘No,’ said the man, ‘he grew
up there, and two angels came, and took him away, and led him into the
wide world.’

And the cow gave birth to a calf, and the man said to his wife: ‘I will
tell you a fine story by the way.’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘do tell one.’ Then
the man began: ‘There was once a little boy who lived alone on a green
island, and the birds had built their nests around him, and the roe and the
chamois came to drink at the brook, and the deer came and browsed by his
side.’ ‘Did the little boy ever go back to his mother?’ asked the woman.
‘No,’ said the man, ‘he grew up there, and two angels came, and took him
away, and led him into the wide world.’

And the cow had two calves, and the man said to his wife: ‘I will tell

","Once upon a time, in a village that lay in a green valley, where the nuts
were very plenty, there lived a poor woodman with his wife and two children.
They were very happy, for the woodman cut fuel for the people of the town,
and so earned a little money; but the best of their fortune was, that they
had a little plot of ground in a wood, where they planted hazel-nuts and
chestnuts, and these gave them a part of their living. One day the woodman
cut down a great tree, and as he was pulling it, it fell against another
tree, that was all alive and full of sap, and the sap ran out and dried up
all the leaves upon the tree. Then the woodman said: ‘How sad it is that
should happen! I cannot bear to see such a beautiful tree die; I will take
care it shall not be all lost, and cut it into rods, and make whips out of
them.’ So he did so, and made seven whips, and put them up in the corner of
the room, where they looked very neat and tidy.

Now it happened that the king of the country passed through the village,
and spent the night at the inn. As he was sitting in the parlour, his eyes
fell on the whips that hung in the corner, and he said: ‘What are these
things?’ ‘O’ said the landlord, ‘they are made of a magical witch’s willow,
and have great power; for every morning and every evening seven birds come
and sing and dance about them; and whosoever will cut one of these whips,
and weave it into a basket, and take it away with him, shall find it full
of the finest pearls the next morning.’ ‘That is a noble gift,’ said the
king; ‘I should like to have one of those baskets.’ Then the landlord said:
‘I will soon get it for you.’ So he went to the woodman, and told him what
the king had said about the baskets, and asked him if he would not give him
one of the whips, and weave a basket out of it. ‘Certainly,’ said the woodman,
‘I have plenty of them.’ Then the landlord took one of the whips, and took
it to the king.

The next morning, when the king got up, he took the basket, and hung it on
his arm, and went out into the court; and as he went, the seven birds came
flying about the whip, and sang and danced; and when they had done, there
were seven thousand pearls in the bottom of the basket. The king was overjoyed
at the sight of this, and went straight to his palace, and showed the
basket to the queen.

The queen had a daughter, who was very beautiful, but so proud that no
one could please her; and when she saw the pearls, she said: ‘I should
like to have one of those baskets for myself.’ Then the king said to the
landlord: ‘Go to the woodman again, and tell him that the queen would like
to have one of the whips.’ The landlord did so, and brought the queen one
of the whips.

The next morning the queen took the whip, and had a basket woven for it,
and took it with her into her bed-chamber, and laid it on her bed. But as
soon as she had left the king’s room, the seven birds came and sang and
danced about the whip; and when they had done, the basket was full of fine
pearls. The queen was delighted to see this, and thought no one knew it;
but the king had seen all that happened, and went into the bed-chamber,
and took some of the pearls out of the basket, and laid them on the table.
Then he called his daughter to him, and said: ‘Look, my child, at the
pearls which the basket has given, and try to please yourself with them.’
But the princess said: ‘La! father, those are coarse pearls, I want fine
ones yet.’

The next morning the queen took the whip, and had a basket made for it,
and took it into her bed-chamber, and laid it on her bed, thinking that no
one saw what she did; but the king saw it all, and took some of the finest
pearls out of the basket, and laid them on the table, and sent his maid
to the princess’s room, and told her to take some of the pearls, and to
lay them before her daughter. Then the maid did as she was told, and the
princess saw the fine pearls, and said: ‘At last, father, I am pleased,
now these are what I call pearls.’

The queen saw that the princess was pleased, and thought she should have
the whip for herself; so the next morning she took it, and had a basket
woven for it, and took it into her bed-chamber; but the king took the basket
away, and carried it into his study, and kept the fine pearls. Then the
queen went to her bed-chamber, and laid herself down upon her bed, and
thought that no one saw what she did; but the king saw it all, and went
into the study, and took some of the finest pearls, and laid them on the
table, and sent his maid to the queen’s bed-chamber, and told her to take
some of the pearls, and to put them by the princess’s pillow, so that when
she awoke in the morning she might think that the basket had been full of
them.

But the queen found the pearls, and thought that the basket must have been
full of them, and laid herself down upon her bed, thinking that no one saw
what she did; but the king saw it all, and went into his study, and took
away the real pearls, and laid some common pebbles on the table, and went
into the queen’s bed-chamber, and took the pearls that were by the
princess’s pillow, and laid them by her own pillow; and then he went out
of the bed-chamber, thinking that the queen had gone to bed, and that no
one saw what he did.

But the queen found the pearls by her pillow, and thought that the basket
must have been full of them, and laid herself down, thinking that no one
saw what she did; but the king saw it all, and went into the study, and
took away the real pearls, and laid some common pebbles on the table, and
took the whip out of the corner, and went into the queen’s bed-chamber,
and took the seven birds away from the whip.

Then the queen awoke in the morning, and thought that the basket must have
been full of pearls, and called her maid, and said: ‘Go and tell the princess
that she must be richer than I am; for by the side of her pillow there
lie pearls which the basket has given us in the night.’ The maid went and
told the princess this, and she jumped up in a great flurry, and looked
at the pearls, and said: ‘Let the whole palace know that I have these
pearls; I will not keep them to myself.’ Then the maid ran to the king,
and told him that the princess wanted to show the pearls to the whole
palace; and the king said: ‘Let her do as she will.’

Then the princess went to the palace, and showed the pearls to the queen,
and said: ‘These are the pearls which my pillow has given me.’ But the
queen looked at them, and saw that they were common pebbles, and said: ‘I
too have had some pearls; let me show you mine.’ Then she took the real

","There was once a king who had a beautiful garden, in which stood
a tree that bore golden apples. These apples were always ripe at
New Year’s time, and the king ordered that they should be placed
in a dish and shown to his guests. Strange to say, the tree bore
but one of these apples every year, and the king thought that this
was very unlucky, for he had many thousand guests to his table, and
one apple was not near enough for all of them.

Now, it chanced that this king had a daughter who was very
beautiful, but so proud that no prince in Christendom was good
enough for her. Then a suitor came from afar, who was called
Drosselmeier, and he was master of the art of making dolls and
living-gardens, and could do many wonderful things. He loved the
king’s daughter, but she did not care anything about him, and was
scornful and rude to him.

The king, however, liked Drosselmeier very much, and one day he
said to him, ‘I have a wish to make you happy, so I will give you
the golden apple out of the tree for your New Year’s gift.’ Then the
girl heard of this, and grew very thoughtful and uneasy. She went
to her father, and said, ‘If you give the apple to Drosselmeier,
I shall have nobody else, for I want to be his wife.’ The king
answered, ‘Dear child, he will have you whether he gets the apple
or not.’

On New Year’s Eve, when the king and all his court were sitting
at the table, and Drosselmeier was also there, the king ordered that
the dish with the golden apple should be brought in. Then the king
said, ‘Drosselmeier, here is the apple for you; I give it to you
as a token of my good will.’

And Drosselmeier took the apple, and said, ‘I thank your majesty
very much, but I like the apple no better than I did when it was
hanging on the tree.’

When the girl heard that, she was very much frightened, and thought
to herself, ‘If the apple pleases him no better now than it did
before, he must have some other sort of apple for his New Year’s
gift.’

The next morning she sent a servant to Drosselmeier, and asked
him whether he had any other kind of apple, for the golden apple
was not to his taste. Then Drosselmeier said, ‘Yes, I have other
apples, but they are not of gold, and one of them is not enough
for you, for you want to eat one after every meal.’

‘Where do the trees grow from which these apples come?’ asked the
king’s daughter.

‘In my garden,’ answered Drosselmeier.

Then the king’s daughter went to him, and said, ‘Dear Drosselmeier,
if you love me, let your garden be near my father’s palace, so that
I may go there whenever I like.’

‘That is easily managed,’ said Drosselmeier, ‘only you must
promise to come thither three times every day, for it is a living
garden, and requires constant attention.’

The king’s daughter agreed to this, and went home, and caused a
walk to be laid out to Drosselmeier’s garden.

It was not long before the garden began to be neglected, for the
king’s daughter never went there as often as she had promised. And
Drosselmeier sent word to her that the apples were all being eaten
up, and that if she did not take more care, there would be none
left. Then she said she would go and water the trees, but she only
went three times a week, and not even then stayed long.

At last the garden was quite neglected, and only a few withered
trees remained standing in it. Then Drosselmeier sent word that
unless she came and watered them, the trees would all die. But she
answered, ‘Let the garden be quite lost, I care nothing about it;
it troubles me very much indeed.’

When Drosselmeier heard that, he went to the king, and said, ‘I
cannot live any longer in a country where people are so ungrateful
and do not keep their word.’

‘What is all this about?’ said the king. ‘Has not my daughter
treated you well?’

‘Your daughter,’ answered Drosselmeier, ‘has broken her word, and
neglected a promise, and has thus destroyed my garden. I cannot
stay here.’

Then the king was very angry with his daughter, and said, ‘You
must bring Drosselmeier’s garden back to its old beauty in three
days, or you shall lose your life.’

But the king’s daughter knew not how to set to work to make the
garden green again, and sat in her chamber very sorrowful and
thoughtful. Presently her old nurse came in, and said, ‘Why are
you so sorrowful?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘I must make Drosselmeier’s
garden green again in three days, or I shall lose my life, and I
do not know how to do it.’

Then the nurse said, ‘I have an old book here, full of magical
formulas, and one of them may help us. Let us try and see what we
can find.’

So they took the book, and read and read, till their eyes ached,
but they found nothing about a living garden. And the first day was
already gone.

On the second day the king’s daughter went out and sat down by
the withered trees, and her heart was very sad and full of grief.
Then a little dwarf came and sat down by her, and said, ‘Why are
you so sorrowful?’

‘Alas!’ said she, ‘I must make this garden green again in two
days, or I shall lose my life, and I do not know how to do it.’

‘What are you called?’ asked the dwarf.

‘I am called--’

‘Do not tell me your name,’ said the dwarf; ‘only tell me what
kind of a bird your father was.’

‘My father was not a bird,’ answered she.

‘Then he was not a king?’ said the dwarf.

‘No, he was not a king.’

‘Then he was not a king’s son?’

‘No, he was not a king’s son.’

‘Then he was not even a court official?’

‘No, he was not a court official.’

‘Then what was he?’ said the dwarf.

‘He was a poor woodman.’

‘And what is your mother?’

‘She is a woodman’s wife.’

‘And how many brothers and sisters have you?’

‘Five brothers.’

‘What are they?’

‘One is a court official, the other is a king’s son, a third is
a king, a fourth is a bird, and the fifth is a dwarf.’

Then the little dwarf was happy, and clapped his hands for joy,
and said, ‘I am your brother the dwarf, and I will help you.’

On the third day the king’s daughter went to Drosselmeier, and
said, ‘I have lost my father, my mother, and all my brothers; but
here is my brother the dwarf, and he has undertaken to make the
garden green again.’

Then Drosselmeier said, ‘I will trust"

","The Enchanted Ring

In a village in the Black Forest there lived a poor woodman with his wife, who toiled hard all
the day long to earn their bread, but often had little or nothing to eat. One day the woman
said to her husband, ‘I will try my luck and cut some wood in the forest, and you can help
me to carry it home.’ So the man said, ‘It will be a good thing to do, for I am very tired
and my hands ache.’

They rose early next morning, and before the sun had climbed half-way up in the heavens,
they had cut and piled up so much wood that they could not carry any more. The wife said,
‘I will lay down by the wood and rest a while, till you come back with another load.’ So
the husband left her, and went home with the wood on his back.

As he was turning round to go back to the forest, he looked sharp and saw with a heavy
heart that she still lay at the foot of the hill, and seemed to be asleep. ‘I will not
wait longer,’ said he, ‘or the evening will overtake me, and then she would certainly
die.’ So he took up the wood and went home, and thought of nothing but how to get
someone to bring his poor wife home. At last he went to the parson, and said, ‘If you
will not help my wife home, she will surely die.’ ‘What has happened?’ asked the parson.
‘She left the forest this morning, to bring wood home with me, and I did not come back
soon enough, and she fell asleep where the wood is piled up, and I left her alone.’ Then
the parson said, ‘I will go with you,’ and they went together, and found her still lying
as if asleep. The parson said, ‘You may go home, I will stay with her.’ So the woodman
went home, but his wife did not awake again, and the next day she was dead.

The parson buried her with his own hands, and when he came back to the village he
said to the woodman, ‘As you and I were the only people she had in the world, I will
take you into my house, and you shall be my servant.’ The woodman agreed to this, and
worked hard for the parson, and did all that he was told.

One day the parson said to him, ‘I am going to the town, and will stay some time, so
you must take care of myself and my house.’ When the parson was gone, the woodman
thought he would walk out and take the air. As he went along, a little dwarf, about
half as high as a man, and as black as coal, came in sight. He came up to the woodman,
and said, ‘Why do you turn your faces so sadly?’ ‘What is that to you, you little fellow?’
said the woodman. ‘Why, I am very sorry for you,’ said the dwarf. ‘What have I done?’
said the woodman. ‘You have nothing to eat, I know, and your master is away, and you
are afraid I shall tell tales and get you into trouble when he comes back.’ ‘How can
you know that?’ said the woodman. ‘Why, I can see everything that happens, and I know
a great many things.’ ‘Well, but what is the use of your knowing? You should do good
with your gift, and not take it about with you like a trinket in your pocket.’ ‘Oh! you
are very saucy, and I don’t much like you.’ ‘Well, if you please, I will tell you a good
deal of what is going on in the world, and in the parson’s house too.’ ‘Well, but what
is the use of that?’ ‘Why, you would like to know what becomes of the pretty girl who
is to be married tomorrow, and whether she will be faithful to her husband, or not.’
‘Well, but is not that silly chatter?’ ‘Oh, yes! I can tell you many things that are a
good deal better worth knowing.’ ‘Well, but what are you himself?’ ‘Why, I am an
enchanted dwarf, and can only take my proper shape three times in a year; and this
is one of those times.’ ‘What do I get by all this?’ said the woodman. ‘Why, I will
tell you a great many things that you would like to know.’ ‘Well, but what is all
this worth?’ ‘Why, I will give you a golden horseshoe, that all the horses in the
world will obey, if you will let me.’ ‘What is that to me?’ said the woodman. ‘Why,
you can put it on any horse you like, and ride him as you please.’ ‘Well, but what
is the use of that?’ ‘Why, you can ride to the sun and moon with him, if you like.’
‘What is that to me?’ ‘Why, you can go to any country you please, and see everything
that is going on in the world.’ ‘Well, but what is the use of that?’ ‘Why, you can
see the most beautiful country that ever was seen, and where there is plenty of
everything.’ ‘Well, but what is the use of that?’ ‘Why, you can stay there as long as
you like.’ ‘Well, but what is the use of that?’ ‘Why, you can bring home with you
whatever you like, and be very much better off than you are.’ ‘Well, but what is
the use of that?’ ‘Why, you can marry, and have children, and they will be better off
than you are.’ ‘Well, but what is the use of that?’ ‘Why, you can live as long as you
please.’ ‘Well, but what is the use of that?’ ‘Why, you can live for ever.’ ‘Well,
but what is the use of that?’ ‘Why, you can be king of the country, and have everything
your own way.’ ‘Well, but what is the use of that?’ ‘Why, you can take all your
friends and relations with you.’ ‘Well, but what is the use of that?’ ‘Why, you can
bring my father and mother out of the sea where they have been enchanted, and set
them free.’ ‘Well, but what is the use of that?’ ‘Why, I will give you my magic ring,

","The Three Little Pigs and the Wolf

Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who set out from their home in search of their fortunes. ‘Brothers,’ said the first, ‘what shall we do? Let us make some agreement among ourselves, that we may not be parted.’ ‘Yes,’ said the second, ‘let us always keep together, and if we meet with any little house, we will build it up together, and live in it.’ ‘Yes,’ said the third, ‘that is a good plan; but let us make haste, for the night is coming on.’

So they journeyed on, till at length they came to a little house made of straw. ‘Here,’ said the first pig, ‘is not room enough for us three to live in this house; let us build a larger.’ So they pulled down the little house, and built a larger one of straw, and then said, ‘Now, this house shall be large enough for us.’ Then the first pig said, ‘I will go into the wood, and cut down some trees, and bring them home, that we may make chairs and tables for our house.’ So off he went, and the second pig said, ‘I will go with him, and lend him a hand.’ So on they went together, and the third pig sat at home in the empty house, with the door left wide open.

Now the wolf watched them as they went along, and when they were a little way off, the wolf ran up to the house, and pushed the door quite open, and then said, ‘What a noble house you have, Mr Pig! I am very hungry; may I lodge with you for a night?’ ‘Oh, no!’ said the pig, ‘we have only three little rooms, and one of them is my bed-room; so we cannot lodge you.’ ‘Only think,’ said the wolf, ‘I shall run you into the wood, and tear you to pieces, if you do not let me in.’ So the pig ran off, and the wolf went in and sat himself down in the chair, and when he sat down the chair broke to pieces, and the wolf fell down upon the floor. Then the wolf got up and went into the bed-room, and there the pig found him, and cried out, ‘Will you eat my bed?’ ‘No,’ said the wolf, ‘but where is that pig who let me in? I will eat him.’ ‘Oh, you wicked wolf!’ said the pig, ‘I am the one; but if you have any claim upon me for letting you in, you must wait till my two brothers come home.’

Meantime the two other pigs had been cutting down the trees, and making the chairs and tables, when they saw a large black cloud of smoke coming in the air. ‘What a strange thing!’ said the first pig, ‘there is no wind; look, how high that smoke rises in the air.’ ‘That is no smoke,’ said the second pig; ‘it is a heavy black cloud.’ ‘Let us run home as fast as we can,’ said the first pig; ‘something must have burnt the house down.’ So away they ran home, and when they got there the wolf was sitting in the chair with a frightened look, and the chair was broken to pieces. ‘What a strange thing!’ said the first pig; ‘our chair has burnt!’ ‘No,’ said the second pig; ‘it is not the chair that has burnt; it is the house.’ ‘Let us go into the bed-room and see if that is burnt.’ So they went into the bed-room, and there lay the wolf, and he said, ‘Your house is all burnt down, is not it?’ ‘No,’ said the first pig; ‘it is you that are burnt.’ ‘Oh, yes,’ said the second pig; ‘you were sitting upon the chair, and it broke to pieces, and you fell into the fire.’ Just then up sprang the wolf, and off he ran. ‘There he goes,’ said the first pig, ‘running away for burning his behind.’

The wolf soon stopped, and lay down under a shrub, and when he saw afar off three people coming along, he cried out, ‘Good morning, good people, what a beautiful morning!’ ‘Yes,’ said the first, ‘it is a beautiful morning, but it is a long time since we have had anything to eat.’ ‘If that be the case,’ said the wolf, ‘I will treat you to some nice pork chops.’ ‘Oh, joy!’ cried the others; ‘take us to the house.’ ‘Come along,’ said the wolf; ‘my house is close by.’ So he took them into his mouth, and as he was going to swallow them down, they pushed out all the bones of his body, and then ran away.

The wolf soon got well, and set out into the world again, and by and by he came to the second little pig’s house. ‘Good morning, Mr Pig,’ said he; ‘how many rooms have you got in your house?’ ‘Two,’ said the pig. ‘May I not lodge with you for one night?’ ‘Oh, no!’ said the pig; ‘I have only two rooms, and one of them is my bed-room; so I cannot lodge you.’ ‘If that be the case,’ said the wolf, ‘you will repent it, for I will run you into the wood, and tear you to pieces.’ So the pig ran off, and the wolf went in and sat himself down in the chair. But the chair broke to pieces, and the wolf fell down upon the floor. Then the pig found him, and said, ‘Will you eat my chair?’ ‘No,’ said the wolf; ‘but where is that pig who let me in? I will eat him.’ ‘Oh, you wicked wolf!’ said the pig, ‘I am the one; but if you have any claim upon me for letting you in, you must wait till my two brothers come home.’

Meantime the two other pigs were at work, making a house of brick for themselves. When they saw the black cloud of smoke in the air, they said, ‘What a strange thing! there is no wind, and yet look, how high that smoke rises in the air.’ ‘That is no smoke,’ said the first pig; ‘it is a heavy black cloud.’ ‘Let us run home as fast as we can,’ said the second pig; ‘something must have burnt our house down.’ So they ran home, and when they got there the wolf was sitting on the floor. ‘Our house is all burnt down, is not it?’ said the first pig. ‘Yes,’ said the second pig; ‘it is you that are burnt.’ ‘Let us go into the bed-room,’ said the first pig, ‘and see if that is burnt.’ So they went into the bed-room, and there lay the wolf, and he said, ‘Your house is all burnt down, is not it?’ ‘No,’ said the first pig; ‘it is you that are burnt.’ ‘Yes,’ said the second pig; ‘you sat upon a chair, and the chair broke to pieces, and you fell into the fire.’ ‘Out with it!’ cried the wolf, and he sprang up, and away he ran. ‘There he goes,’ said the first pig, ‘running away for burning his behind.’

The wolf soon stopped, and lay down under a bush, and when he saw afar off three people coming along, he cried out, ‘Good morning, good people, what a beautiful morning!’ ‘Yes,’ said the first, ‘it is a beautiful morning, but we have had nothing to eat for a long time.’ ‘If that be the case,’ said the wolf, ‘I will treat you to some nice pork chops.’ ‘Oh, joy!’ cried the others; ‘take us to your house.’ ‘Come along,’ said the wolf; ‘my house is close by.’ So he took them into his mouth, and as he was going to swallow them down, they pushed out all the bones of his body, and then ran away.

","The Shepherd and the Star

There was once a poor shepherd who watched his flock by day and by night upon the lonely heath. His flock was small, and what he earned by selling the wool and the flesh was just enough to keep his wife and two children from dying of hunger. One evening as he sat by the fire, his little daughter came running to him, and said, ‘Dear father, there is a strange star in the sky.’ The shepherd looked up, and saw that it was true; a star burned bright in the heavens, which he had never seen before. ‘It is lucky we should see such a star,’ said he to his wife; ‘perhaps our fortunes will change for the better.’ Then he took his pipe and smoked, and his wife took her spinning-wheel and began to work, but the little girl crept up to her father’s knee and said, ‘Tell me a tale, father.’ ‘What tale would you have?’ said he. ‘I know not which.’ ‘Then tell me the tale of the shepherd who found the treasure.’

So the shepherd began his tale.

‘There was once a shepherd like unto myself, and his flock was but small; yet he trusted in God that he should some day find a treasure, and become a rich man. One day as he was walking in the fields with his pipe in his mouth, he saw a man sitting in the grass, with his face turned to the sky. And the shepherd went up to him, and said, “What seek you here?” And the man turned his face from the sky, and looked at the shepherd, and said, “I am looking for a treasure that lies hidden beneath the green grass.” Then the shepherd said, “What is it that you see in the sky, that you should look so steadfastly thither?” And the man said, “I see a star that burns bright, and I know that all my wishes will be fulfilled when it rises here upon the earth.”

‘So they went back to the shepherd’s cottage, and sat down by the fire, and the shepherd gave his guest meat and drink. And when they had eaten and drunk, the man said, “I will tell you how we may find the treasure.” Then the shepherd’s eyes sparkled with joy, and he clapped his hands for glee. “Yes,” said the man, “we will go forth together by night, when the moon is full, and we will dig in the place where the grass grows thickest and greenest; for there the treasure lies hidden.” So the shepherd said, “My eldest son shall go with us,” and the man said, “So shall his youngest son.” Then they swore a great oath, that they would keep each other’s secret, and that they would share the treasure equally between them.

‘So they went forth by night, when the moon was full, and they found the place where the grass grew thickest and greenest, and there they began to dig. And the shepherd’s eldest son dug all one night, and all the next day, and all the night following; and so did the man’s son. And the shepherd and the man watched the two boys, that they might not play a trick and steal away. And the third night came, and the shepherd was so tired that his eyes would not stay open, and he said to the man, “I must go home and lie down, for my legs will carry me no farther; but you and the boys must watch, and dig till you come to the treasure.” Then the man said, “I will watch with the boys.” So the shepherd turned away, and went home through the heath.

‘But the man said to the boys, “My little lambs, why do you work so hard, and dig so deep, and find nothing? The treasure cannot be very far down there. Let us rest a while, and then we will dig again.” So they laid aside their picks, and sat themselves down upon the ground, and the man took a book out of his pocket, and read to them. And the boys listened, and were so pleased with the tale that they forgot to think of their labour, and sat listening till the first cock crowed. Then the man said, “Now, my little lambs, let us go to bed and sleep a while, and then we will work again.” So they laid themselves down upon the grass, and slept.

‘When the shepherd rose up in the morning, he went to the place where he had left the man and the boys; but they were all asleep, and he waked them up, saying, “Rise, rise! the day is far advanced, and we shall not finish our work if we tarry any longer.” Then the man said, “I had a wonderful dream; I dreamt that we had dug deep enough, and that we saw the treasure lying there, but that a great dragon came forth and would have stolen it away from us, if we had not pulled it out quickly.” And the boys said, “We too have had wonderful dreams; we dreamt that the dragon was already gone, and that we were sharing the treasure between us three.”

‘Then they went back to the shepherd’s cottage, and ate and drank, and told all their adventures. And the shepherd said, “Now will I go with you, and we will dig together, and see if we cannot find the treasure.” So they all went forth together, and the shepherd brought an axe with him, and cut away the grass that grew over the place where they were to dig. And when they began to dig, they found, as they had dreamt, the treasure beneath; but scarcely had they lifted it up, when the dragon came rushing out of his cave, and snatched the treasure away, and went rolling and tossing it in the air, and at last flew away with it upon his back. Then the three men stood and gazed upon each other, and sorrowed sorely for the loss of their treasure.

‘But the shepherd said, “I will run and overtake the dragon, and take away the treasure by force.” So he began to run, and the dragon flew on slowly, not thinking that the shepherd would overtake him. And the shepherd ran on so fast that he soon came up to the dragon, and took hold of the treasure, and said, “Thou villain, thou hast cheated us! Thou shalt not carry our treasure away upon thy back.” And then he began to strike at the dragon, and the dragon set the treasure down, and turned upon the shepherd, and bit him, and dragged him upon the ground, and rolled him again and again till he was dead. And when the man and the two boys saw that, they turned and fled, and left the dead body of the shepherd upon the ground.

‘And now, my child, the tale comes back to me again. The shepherd is dead, and the dragon has the treasure; and we are left with our little flocks upon the lonely heath, where there is neither meat nor drink, nor wood to burn upon the fire. And what reward shall we have for our labour? Truly, none at all.’

As the shepherd finished his tale, the little girl wept, and said, ‘O dear father, what a sad tale that is! Pray tell me another.’ ‘What tale shall I tell?’ said the shepherd. ‘I know not which.’ ‘Then tell me the tale of the shepherd who followed the bear.’

So the shepherd began his tale again.

‘There was once a shepherd like unto myself, and his flock was but small; yet he trusted in God that he should some day find a treasure, and become a rich man. One day as he was walking in the fields with his pipe in his mouth, he saw a bear running towards him. Then he was sore afraid, and turned to fly; but he soon found himself so surrounded that he could go no farther. So he said to the bear, “Why have you made me afraid, and run me in at every step?

","Once upon a time there lived a poor old woman who had but one cow. She loved that cow very much, and took good care of it; but still it gave her very little milk, so that she could not even keep herself alive upon it. Now now she heard of a powerful fairy, who had the power of giving whatever she chose to any one who would visit her. Then the old woman said to herself, ‘What can I wish for? I will not ask for riches, for what can I do with riches when I have no health to enjoy them? I will ask for a cow that will give me as much milk as I desire.’ So she set out and found the fairy, and told her what she wanted. The fairy said, ‘You must bring me, in return, the calf of the cow when it is born, and give it to my cook to kill.’ The old woman consented, and the fairy gave her the cow that would give as much milk as she wished.

So the old woman went home, and her cow gave so much milk that she could drink of it as much as she wished, and yet the cow was never empty. Then she became happy, and lived upon milk to her heart’s desire.

After a while the calf was born, and the old woman was forced to take it to the fairy, and give it to her cook to kill. Now the cook wanted to have the best part of the calf, so he cut off the head and the legs and shoulders, and gave the rest of it to the maid to make into sausages. But the old woman’s calf spoke to the maid, and said, ‘Lay me on the oven that I may cook myself, and take me out when I am brown.’ The maid did as she was told, and when the calf was quite brown, the cook wanted to throw it away. But when he lifted it up, it cried, ‘Take me to my master the fairy.’ Then the cook was afraid, and carried it to the fairy, who said, ‘What does this mean?’ The cook made bold to say that the old woman had taken the calf from him, and had killed it herself.

The fairy flew into a rage, and called the old woman before her, and threatened to take away the power of giving milk from her cow if she had taken away her calf. But the old woman said, ‘Heaven forbid that I should do such a thing! If I killed the calf, why then do you see it is alive?’ Then the fairy was forced to acknowledge that the cook had told a lie, and that the calf was still alive.

She sent the cook to the mill to be ground to death in a mill, and said to the old woman, ‘As you have kept your word, I will keep mine. Your cow shall have as much milk as you desire.’

And so the old woman went home, and her cow was still the cow that gave as much milk as she wished, and she lived happily to the end of her days.

","The Wolf and the Seven Little Kids

There was once a wolf who had lost all his hair, and could therefore
no longer be reckoned very formidable. So he went about in search of
work, and at last came to a meadow where seven little kids were lying
feeding themselves. ‘Good day, children,’ said he to them, ‘how is all
with you?’ ‘Oh,’ said the kids, ‘we are very well, but who is that
that talks with such a horrid ugly face?’ ‘I am only a poor wolf,’
answered the other, ‘and as you see, I have not a hair on my body;
but I am very weak, and have not eaten a morsel for three days; so
if you will let me share your dinner, I shall be very thankful.’ ‘Poor
thing,’ said the kids, ‘we pity you; you shall indeed share our
dinner, but you must lie down over there, a little way off.’ So the
wolf lay down a little way off, and the kids went back to their food,
and ate as before. But when they had eaten half their dinner, they
began to be uneasy, and looked round to see if the wolf was still a
long way off; but he had crept nearer, and they could not tell whether
he would not soon pounce upon them and devour them all. Then the first
said: ‘Brother Kid, shall I run, or shall we stand and defend ourselves?’
‘No,’ said the second, ‘let us stand and defend ourselves.’ ‘But I
am afraid he will bite us,’ said the first. ‘Oh!’ answered the second,
‘he will not be so bold as that; he is so ugly that even a crow would
not come near him.’ So they stood fast, and the wolf came nearer and
nearer, till at last he was quite close to them. Then he seized them,
one after another, and ate them up, and there was not one left.

The next day, as the mother of the seven kids came home and found them
all gone, she inquired what had become of them. ‘I do not know,’ said
the first little goat, ‘I was lying feeding myself, and when I looked
round, they were all gone.’ ‘But where is your brother?’ said the old
goat. ‘Oh, he ran away, he was afraid.’ ‘No, that is not true,’ said
the second kid, ‘we were all lying down feeding ourselves, and when I
looked up, they were gone, and I do not know where they have gone.’
‘But where is your brother?’ said the old goat. ‘Oh, he ran away, he
was afraid.’ ‘No, that is not true,’ said the third kid. ‘We were all
lying down feeding ourselves, and when I looked up, they were gone, and
I do not know where they have gone.’ ‘But where is your brother?’ said
the old goat. ‘Oh, he ran away, he was afraid.’ ‘No, that is not
true,’ said the fourth kid. ‘We were all lying down feeding ourselves,
and when I looked up, they were gone, and I do not know where they have
gone.’ ‘But where is your brother?’ said the old goat. ‘Oh, he ran away,
he was afraid.’ ‘No, that is not true,’ said the fifth kid. ‘We were
all lying down feeding ourselves, and when I looked up, they were gone,
and I do not know where they have gone.’ ‘But where is your brother?’
said the old goat. ‘Oh, he ran away, he was afraid.’ ‘No, that is not
true,’ said the sixth kid. ‘We were all lying down feeding ourselves,
and when I looked up, they were gone, and I do not know where they have
gone.’ ‘But where is your brother?’ said the old goat. ‘Oh, he ran away,
he was afraid.’ ‘No, that is not true,’ said the seventh kid. ‘We were
all lying down feeding ourselves, and when I looked up, they were gone,
and I do not know where they have gone.’ ‘But where is your brother?’
said the old goat. ‘Oh, he ran away, he was afraid.’ Then the old goat
said: ‘All you little rascals have been false to me, and have told me
that your brother ran away, when he was really carried off by a wolf;
so, that I may know where you live, tell me truly.’

So the first said: ‘We have been feeding ourselves on the further
side of the wood.’ ‘And you,’ said the old goat to the second, ‘where
have you been feeding yourselves?’ ‘On the further side of the wood,
like the others.’ ‘And you,’ said the old goat to the third, ‘where
have you been feeding yourselves?’ ‘On the further side of the wood,
like the others.’ ‘And you,’ said the old goat to the fourth, ‘where
have you been feeding yourselves?’ ‘On the further side of the wood,
like the others.’ ‘And you,’ said the old goat to the fifth, ‘where
have you been feeding yourselves?’ ‘On the further side of the wood,
like the others.’ ‘And you,’ said the old goat to the sixth, ‘where
have you been feeding yourselves?’ ‘On the further side of the wood,
like the others.’ ‘And you,’ said the old goat to the seventh, ‘where
have you been feeding yourselves?’ ‘On the further side of the wood,
like the others.’ Then the old goat went to the wood, and cried out:
‘Where are you, you wolf?’ And the wolf answered: ‘Who has been
calling the old goat?’ ‘I have,’ said the old goat. ‘All right,’ said
the wolf, ‘come up higher into the wood, and I will show you where I
have hidden the kids.’ Then the old goat went up into the wood, and the
wolf seized him, and devoured him, and afterwards threw his skin aside,
and lay down in it himself. When the old goat was dead, the wolf went
out and called the first kid, and said: ‘All is well, you may come
out; I have killed the old goat, and there is no one now to harm you;
so come and put on your clothes.’ ‘Oh,’ said the first kid, ‘my clothes
are up in the bush there; I will go and get them.’ ‘No, you don’t,’
said the wolf, ‘I will go myself; you shall stand there and wait
near me.’ Then the wolf went into the bush, tore down all the old
goat’s clothes, put them on, and came out with a savage face and a
horrid grin. ‘Well,’ said he to the first kid, ‘now go and find the
others, and make them come out; I have disposed of their clothes also,
and put them all on.’ So the first kid went away and called the second
kid, who came and stood before him. ‘What are you looking for, little
kid?’ said the other. ‘I am looking for my clothes,’ answered the
second kid. ‘Where have you put them?’ ‘I have put them behind the
stone-bench there; I will go and get them.’ ‘No, you don’t,’ said the
first kid. ‘I will go myself; you shall stand there and wait near me.’
Then the first kid went with the second kid’s clothes, and did the
same with them as he had done with the first. After this, he called
the third kid, and made him put on his clothes, and so he did with the
fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh. When all were dressed, the wolf said"

","Once upon a time, in a village that lay in a green valley, where the blue
mountains shut in the horizon, there lived a poor old woman. Her only
furniture consisted of a bed, a table, two benches, and a cupboard. In
the cupboard was one dish, one spoon, one fork, one knife, and one glass.
In one corner stood the old woman’s bed; in the other was a table with
the dish, etc., upon it. Upon the wall hung a cooking-pot and a frying-pan.
In front of the house was a rack where the old woman hung her broom and
her besom. Behind the house was a little garden, in which she grew some
herbs and vegetables. In front of the house was a broad pavement, upon
which the old woman laid a bench, upon which she sat when the weather was
fine, and when she had nothing else to do.

Now it happened that the old woman had nothing to do, for she was very
poor, and could not afford to buy anything, and could not earn anything
by working, because she was so very old. So she sat upon her bench and
looked towards the road, and when any travellers came in sight she ran
out and begged a boon. But the travellers seldom gave her anything, for
they knew that she had nothing to bestow in return, and they did not
like empty-handed people.

One day, as she sat looking very sorrowful and miserable, a stranger
approached. ‘What is the matter, my good woman?’ said he. ‘Ah! sir,’ said
she, ‘what can you do or what have you got with you that would interest
me?’ ‘I have nothing to offer you,’ said the stranger, ‘but I will give
you as much gold as that dish holds.’ ‘How can you do that?’ said the
old woman. ‘Just say please,’ replied the stranger, ‘and it is done.’ ‘Oh!
if you can do that,’ said the old woman, ‘then you can give me my heart’s
desire.’ ‘And what is that?’ said the stranger. ‘Why, to have a dish
full of food set before me every day.’ ‘Is that all?’ said the stranger.
‘That is nothing to what I proposed, but if you please I will grant your
wish.’ ‘Then please God, sir, say so,’ said the old woman, ‘and I will
be very thankful.’ ‘It is done,’ said the stranger; ‘you shall have as
much food as you can eat, set before you every day.’ ‘All this is true,’
said the old woman to the people of the village, ‘and therefore I wish
everybody would wish me “Good morrow.”’ So thenceforth all the people
who passed, whether they knew her or not, called out ‘Good morrow’ to
her, and she was always well provided with good food.

Some time after this a man came into the village, who was very wise, and
famous all over the land for his wisdom. Now it so happened that as he
was travelling along, his way led him through the green valley, and as he
was drawing near the village he heard a woman singing. So he went to see
who it was, and he found it was the old woman. ‘Why,’ said he, ‘what a
noise you make! What are you about?’ ‘Why,’ said she, ‘I am singing for
joy because I have plenty to eat.’ ‘What do you call plenty?’ said the
man. ‘Why,’ said she, ‘every morning as soon as I get up, my dish is
full, and I eat and eat, and still there is room for more.’ ‘Who gave
you that as a gift?’ said the man. ‘A strange man,’ said she, ‘who gave
me a lump of gold as big as the dish, and said I might have as much as
it would hold, and told me that if anybody would please me they must
wish me “Good morrow.”’ ‘Ah!’ said the man, ‘you have not used your
wish wisely. You ought to have asked for wealth, for gold and silver, and
precious stones, and you would have had enough of all these, and could
have given the stranger something in return for his gift.’ ‘What would
you have done?’ said the old woman. ‘Why,’ said the man, ‘I should have
asked for a dish full of gold every day.’ ‘But I like my present,’ said
the old woman, ‘for I have plenty to eat, and I will not change it for
all the wealth in the world.’

Now the man thought to himself that the old woman would have been a
great deal better off if she had taken his advice; so he went away, and
travelled on through the green valley. As he went on, he saw a man who
was making a most furious noise, and jumping about and dancing. ‘What are
you about, my friend?’ said the wise man to the other. ‘Can you tell me
what has happened?’ ‘Why,’ said the man, ‘I am delighted. I am rich,
rich, rich!’ ‘What have you got?’ said the wise man. ‘Why,’ said the
man, ‘I had nothing to do, and had not a penny in the world to buy
anything with, and I met a strange man, who asked me what I would wish
for, and I said, “I wish for a dish of food that would never leave me
hungry.” And now, as I live, I am never again in danger of dying of
hunger.’ ‘Ah!’ said the wise man, ‘you might have asked for a dish of gold
every day, and then you would have had enough to eat as long as it
lasted, and would have had plenty to sell to buy food.’ ‘What’s the use
of gold?’ said the man. ‘Can it satisfy my hunger?’ ‘No,’ said the wise
man, ‘but it would buy you food.’ ‘I don’t want to trouble myself about
that,’ said the man; ‘I am very thankful for what I have got, and I will
not change it for all the wealth in the world.’

Then the wise man went on through the green valley, and as he went he
heard a great noise of laughing and merrymaking. He went to see what
was the matter, and he found a man who was dancing for joy, and who had
a gold dish full of ducats by him. ‘What are you about, my friend?’ said
the wise man. ‘What’s the meaning of all this?’ ‘Why,’ said the man, ‘I
am rich, I am rich!’ ‘What have you got?’ said the wise man. ‘Why,’ said
the man, ‘I had nothing to do, and I met a strange man, who asked me what
I would wish for, and I said, “I wish for a dish of gold.” And now, as
I live, I have got a dish of gold.’ ‘Ah!’ said the wise man, ‘you might
have asked for a dish of food that would never leave you hungry.’ ‘What
is food to a man who has gold?’ said the other. ‘Can you buy beef and
beer with ducats?’ ‘No,’ said the man, ‘but you can buy them with the
money that ducats will buy.’ ‘Well,’ said the wise man, ‘your wish is
granted, and you will always have plenty of money, but you have lost the
chance of having plenty of food.’ ‘I don’t care for food,’ said the man,
‘if I have money; what can I want with beef and beer, when I can buy
them?’

Then the wise man went on through the green valley, and as he went he
heard a great noise of feasting and revelry."

","There was once a man who had a horse that had been his companion for many years, but now was grown too old to be of any use. His master, therefore, no longer took any care of him, and let him run in the woods as much as he pleased; but still he always came home to his stable at night.

One day it so happened that the man had to go a long way, and when he was ready to start he went into the stable to get his horse and found him not there. He called him, but all in vain; then he was grieved, and said, ‘Alas! my old companion, what will become of thee in the wood, where all sorts of wild beasts abound?’

When the horse heard this he turned white with fear, and trotted home as fast as he could to his master’s house, and from that time forward never left it.

Some time after, the man wanted to go a second time, and again looked for his horse, but could not find him; and when he had searched in vain for a long time, he went into the house very much grieved, and said, ‘Alas! I see I cannot keep even one horse; they all run away from me.’

Then the horse, that was all the time standing in the field, heard him, and was so frightened that he turned white, and when his master came home he trotted up to meet him, and from that time forward always remained at home.

Some time after, the man wanted to go a third time, and looked for his horse; but he was not to be found, and his master, seeing him nowhere, said, ‘This time he has certainly run away, and will never come back.’

The horse, however, was standing all the time in his stall, and hearing his master speak of him as having run away, was so frightened that he turned pale, and when the man came home he came to meet him, and from that time forward never left home again.

One day the man wanted to go a fourth time, and went to look for his horse; but he was not there, and his master said, ‘He has run away, and will never come back.’ Then the horse, that was all the time in his stall, heard him speak of running away, and was so frightened that he turned pale, and when his master came home he came to meet him, and from that time forward never went out of his stable at all.

When the man came home the fourth time, he went into the stable and found his horse standing in his stall; but he was so pale and meagre that he could not have weighed above a hundred pounds. Then he seized him by the bridle and said, ‘Why, what is the matter with you? You have run away, have you? You have been in the wood, have you? You have been eating grass, have you? You have been drinking water, have you? You have been carrying anyone on your back, have you?’ But the horse did not say a word, and just shook his head.

Then his master took him to the field, and made him pull at the plough; but he could hardly move it, and soon fell down exhausted, and lay panting and gasping for breath. Then his master scolded him, and said, ‘You wretch! you have run away, have you? You have been in the wood, have you? You have been eating grass, have you? You have been drinking water, have you? You have been carrying anyone on your back, have you?’

And the horse did not say a word, but just shook his head.

Then his master made him rise, and took him to the mill; but when he began to work and turn the mill, he fell down and did not turn it at all, but lay there gasping for breath. Then the master was very angry, and said, ‘You wretch! you have run away, have you? You have been in the wood, have you? You have been eating grass, have you? You have been drinking water, have you? You have been carrying anyone on your back, have you?’

But the horse did not say a word, and only shook his head.

Then the master took him to the river, and made him stand in the stream, and said, ‘Now, at last, you must carry someone across; you have had enough rest.’ But when he began to do it, he fell down in the middle of the stream and could not stir, and there he lay gasping for breath, with the water running over him.

Then the master was very, very angry, and said, ‘You wretch! you have run away, have you? You have been in the wood, have you? You have been eating grass, have you? You have been drinking water, have you? You have been carrying anyone on your back, have you?’

And the horse did not say a word, but only shook his head.

Then the master took a heavy whip and lashed him till the blood ran, and said, ‘You wretch! you have run away, have you? You have been in the wood, have you? You have been eating grass, have you? You have been drinking water, have you? You have been carrying anyone on your back, have you?’

And the horse did not say a word, but only shook his head.

Then his master went home, and left him standing in the river, and he lay there till the blood ran out of him, and at last gave his soul into the hands of God.

Then came up a little grey mouse, and stood at his head, and said, ‘Why did you tell that falsehood? Why did you say that you had never carried anyone on your back? I heard you say that you had carried my poor mother the millstone from the mill to the river. Now then, as you have told falsehoods, you shall die a miserable death.’

And when she had said that, she pinched his bones, one after another, till they were all picked, and then went away.

And soon came up a black rat, and stood at his head, and said, ‘Why did you tell that falsehood? Why did you say that you had never carried anyone on your back? I heard you say that you had carried my poor father the millstone from the river to the mill. Now then, as you have told falsehoods, you shall die a miserable death.’

And when she had said that, she pinched his bones, one after another, till they were all picked, and then went away.

And soon came up a white cat, and stood at his head, and said, ‘Why did you tell that falsehood? Why did you say that you had never carried anyone on your back? I heard you say that you had carried my poor mother the cook in the ship from the ship to the shore. Now then, as you have told falsehoods, you shall die a miserable death.’

And when she had said that, she pinched his bones, one after another, till they were all picked, and then went away.

And soon came up a black dog, and stood at his head, and said, ‘Why did you tell that falsehood? Why did you say that you had never carried anyone on your back? I heard you say that you had carried my poor master, who is now king of this land, from the ship to the shore. Now then, as you have told falsehoods, you shall die a miserable death.’

And when he had said that, he pinched his bones, one after another, till they were all picked, and then went away.

And soon came up a fox, and stood at his head, and said, ‘Why did you tell that falsehood? Why did you say that you had never carried anyone on your back? I heard you say that you had carried my poor father from the gallows to the wood. Now then, as you have told falsehoods, you shall die a miserable death.’

And when he had said that, he pinched his bones, one after another, till they were all picked, and then went away.

And soon came up a wolf, and stood at his head, and said, ‘Why did"

","There was once a king who had a beautiful garden full of all kinds of fine flowers, and in the middle stood a large tree. It was so old that one of its branches touched the sky, and it was so big that you could not reach around it with your arms. And when the wind blew, it swayed to and fro with such a strange noise that it was said to be haunted. But the king’s daughter went there every day, and sat down under the old tree, and she could not believe that it was haunted.

One day she took with her a little basket of bread crumbs, and as she sat there eating, a small, small, very small, old man appeared. At first he was so small that he could just barely walk in and out among the tree’s roots, but he ate and grew bigger and bigger, until he was as big as a man. Then he looked at the princess, and said, ‘Lady, why do you come here every day?’ ‘Because I like to be alone, and here I am best alone,’ answered she. ‘If that be so,’ said the little man, ‘then I will keep your secret, and no one in the world shall know it; but promise me that you will promise me something in return.’ ‘What should I promise you?’ said the princess. ‘That you will give me your ring,’ answered the little man. ‘I will promise you anything only promise not to ask me for my ring.’ So they spent the day very pleasantly together, and the little man went away.

The next day the princess took with her a shining golden ring, and the little man came again, but he abode not so small as before, but sat himself upon the grass and ate no more. Then she told him everything that had happened to her, and how no one believed that she could not be haunted, for the old tree was said to be haunted. ‘Alas!’ said the princess, ‘I should like to know whether it be so or not.’ ‘Then promise me,’ said the little man, ‘that you will give me your golden ring, if I will go into the tree and find out for you.’ ‘I will promise you anything, only promise not to ask me for my golden ring.’ So on the third day the little man went into the tree, and the princess waited till he came out again. But he did not come out at all, and the princess waited till the evening, and then went home, very much grieved.

The next day she took with her a shining golden ring, and went to the tree, and said, ‘Dear little man, do go into the old tree and find out if it be haunted or not.’ ‘I will go,’ said the little man, and away he went. But he did not come out again at all, and the princess was very much grieved, and went home in the evening.

","There was once a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run alone.

The child was fair and good, but very, very mischievous; and the queen, trying to check her naughtiness, gave her a little nut, and said, ‘From this time forward you shall be called Hazel-nut, and as long as this nut lasts, you shall have whatever it is you can say when I open the door to go out.’

The little girl liked this very much, and when her mother went out, she always stood by the door and said something, and her mother had to tell her what she should have. Thus she got books, and balls, and apples, and pears, and all things that she could think of, till the nut was nearly gone.

Then she said, ‘Mother, I want a fine doll.’ ‘What will you say when I go out?’ said the mother. ‘I will say, “I want a fine doll.”’ ‘Go on, then, and tell your father.’

But the father said, ‘My dear child, you have had many things, now you shall have air and exercise, and have the window opened.’

The little girl was very angry, and her mother heard her muttering something as she went out. She thought nothing of it, but went out herself. Then the little girl said, ‘The wind,’ and a little wind came, and blew the window all to pieces. Her father became very angry, and said, ‘You shall have nothing more, till you have paid for the window.’

The child was still more angry, and when her mother went out she said, ‘The storm.’ And a storm came, and all the roof was blown away. Then her father said, ‘You shall not have meat or drink till you have paid for the roof.’

When her mother went out she said, ‘The hail.’ And such a hailstorm came, that all the fruit in the garden was broken. Then her father said, ‘You shall not have anything to eat or drink till you have paid for the fruit.’

When her mother went out she said, ‘The fire.’ And a fire came, and burnt down the house over her. Then her father said, ‘You shall have nothing to eat or drink, nor wear clothes, till you have paid for all.’

So the little girl stood by the door, and her mother asked her what she wanted. ‘I want air to breathe,’ said she. ‘Then you shall have it,’ said the mother, ‘but you shall not have meat or drink, nor wear clothes, till you are big.’

So the child had nothing to eat or drink, nor to wear, and was very, very hungry and cold. But she was still pretty, and people came from all around to look at her, and she danced and capered about, and was merry.

Now there was a king’s son in the country, who heard of this little dancing girl, and went to see her. ‘Dance for me, little girl,’ said he. Then she danced and capered about, and was very merry. ‘Shall I dance for you again?’ said she. ‘Yes,’ said he. So she danced again, and was very merry. ‘Shall I dance for you a third time?’ said she. ‘Yes,’ said he. But this time she danced so high and so wildly, that she got upon his horse’s back, and so away.

Then the king’s son was very angry, and he followed her, and she rode on and on, till at last she came to a little cottage. ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘I cannot go in, for I am clad in rags and have nothing to eat.’ Then a little dwarf came out, and he took her in, and gave her meat and drink, and made her a pretty little bed, and said, ‘Lie down and sleep.’ So she slept, and when she awoke all her clothes were got ready, and she was as pretty as ever.

Then the little dwarf said, ‘I see that you are in trouble, and that you are very, very hungry. I will take you into the town, and there you shall have meat and drink, and whatever you want.’ So he took her into the town, and she ate and drank, and bought whatever she wanted.

But when she had eaten and dressed herself, she said to the little dwarf, ‘I am very, very cold.’ Then the little dwarf said, ‘I see that you are in trouble, and that you are very, very cold. I will take you to the king’s palace, and there you shall have heat and light, and whatever you want.’ So he took her to the king’s palace, and she went from room to room, till she came to the king’s bed-chamber, and lay down by the side of the king’s son, and soon fell asleep.

In the morning the king’s son awoke, and saw her, and said, ‘Shall I kill her?’ But the dwarf said, ‘No, she is no common child.’ Then the king’s son said, ‘She shall be my wife.’ But the dwarf said, ‘She must first eat a pear, which is bigger than her head.’ Now the dwarf brought the pear from home. So they gave her the pear to eat, and when it was eaten, she became bigger and bigger, and at last was as big as a mountain. Then said the king’s son to the dwarf, ‘Now take her away, and let her go home to her own country.’ So the dwarf took her home, and set her down before her father’s house, and she was so big that her head touched the sky.

Then her father and mother came to meet her, and her father said, ‘Little Hazel-nut, how have you been travelling?’ ‘Oh, father,’ said she, ‘I have been to the sun and moon.’ ‘And how came you home?’ said her father. ‘Oh, father,’ said she, ‘the wind took me home.’ ‘What did you wear?’ said her father. ‘Oh, father,’ said she, ‘the rain and dew fell on me, and I wore them for clothes.’ ‘What did you eat?’ said her father. ‘Oh, father,’ said she, ‘the locusts and grasshoppers came and ate me.’ ‘What did you do?’ said her father. ‘Oh, father,’ said she, ‘I danced, and they clapped their hands and capered about, and set the whole land in motion, and carried me along with them.’

Then they knew that she was still the same little Hazel-nut, and they rejoiced, and danced, and feasted, and made merry, and welcomed her home.

","The Enchanted Fiddle

There was once a poor woodman, who cut wood in the forest, and earned just
enough to support himself and his wife, and keep themselves from dying of
hunger. One day he cut down a mighty tree, and as he was pulling it, it
fell against his foot, so that he cried out in pain, and the blood ran
abundantly. Then he was very sad, for he saw that the injury was not
light, and he could not go home. ‘What shall I do?’ said he. ‘I cannot
sit here and wait till I die of hunger, and I cannot go home and trouble my
wife with my misfortunes.’ At last he thought of the ravens, and cried
aloud: ‘Dear ravens, my friends of old, come hither and help me!’ But the
ravens did not come. ‘Ungrateful creatures!’ said he; ‘they will not help
me in my need.’ Then he cried: ‘If you are not my friends, at least you
ought to be so for fear of God!’ But still the ravens did not come. So he
walked on with his wounded foot, and after a time came to a little cottage,
where an old woman lived, who was renowned for her skill in healing all
kinds of wounds. He knocked at the door, and when she came out, he told her
his tale, and begged her to heal his foot. She looked at it, and said:
‘I will heal thy foot, if thou wilt work hard for me, and do all I bid thee
for a whole year.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said the woodman; ‘only do as thou
wilt, and I am thy servant.’

So she washed the wound with a decoction of herbs, and bound it up, and
when he had stayed a month, his foot was healed, and he was able to go home
to his wife. Then the old woman said to him: ‘Listen, woodman, I have
healed thee, but thou must keep myself in bondage for a year, and work
hard for me.’ ‘What shall I do?’ asked the woodman. ‘Every Saturday night
and Sunday I must bring you the most beautiful flower which blooms in the
forest, and every Friday evening I must bring you here the fattest venison,
and every holiday a cake made of the finest flour, and besides this I
must work in your garden, and do all the work of the house.’ ‘Is all this
needful?’ asked the woodman. ‘Oh, no!’ answered the old woman, ‘I am only
so old and weak that I cannot do as I would like, and I have no near
relatives to help me; so you must do all you can to make me comfortable,
and then I will give you a magic fiddle, which will enable you to draw
whatever you please with it.’

The woodman consented, and worked hard for the old woman, and thought
himself fortunate in having such a treasure as the fiddle to look forward
to. Every week he went into the forest to seek for the beautiful flower,
and every deer which came in his way he brought home, and every time there
was a holiday he baked a cake. But the old woman’s garden wanted constant
cultivating, and there was always some task to be done in the house.

And now it came to pass that the woodman’s wife was one day standing in
the street, and the gold from her ring fell off, and rolled into the gutter.
When she saw this she began to cry, and said: ‘Alas, what will become of
me? I know not where my husband is, and I cannot go to look for him, for
if I do I should be sure to forget the time, and then the children would
be left alone. What a wretched wife I am!’ And she wept and lamented over
her lost gold, and did not think of the time, but her eldest boy came home
from school, and her second boy came in from playing, and then she saw that
she had kept them alone, and was very sorry.

Meantime the woodman came home, and asked his wife what made her weep.
Then she told him all her trouble, and said: ‘How can you work so hard, and
leave your poor wife and children alone?’ ‘I cannot help that,’ said the
woodman; ‘I must do what I can to get the magic fiddle.’ ‘But I cannot have
you at all, if you are going to leave me in this way.’ ‘I will do what I
can to help you,’ said the woodman. ‘I will take the children with me to
the forest, and cut us a hut there, and you shall come and visit us at
any time.’ The wife liked this plan very much, and the woodman cut down a
tree, and built a hut for himself and his wife and children in the forest.
Then he made a bed of moss for his wife, and one for himself, and one for
each of his children, and brought her thither, and she was very glad to
see it. ‘Now,’ said she, ‘I will take a walk in the forest, and see how
beautiful it is.’ So she went away, and the woodman watched the children,
that they did not run about and get lost. And when his wife had been away
a long time, he sent one of his boys to call her, but he came back and said
she was not within the hut. Then he sent the other, but he also returned,
and said he could not find her. ‘What shall I do?’ said the woodman. ‘I will
go myself, and see if I can find her.’ But he sought his wife all round,
and could nowhere see her, and he was very much frightened, and ran home to
the old woman, and said: ‘My wife has been living with me in the forest,
but she has lost herself there, and I am sure she will never find her way
home again.’ Then the old woman comforted him, and said: ‘I will play on
my fiddle, and she will hear it and follow the sound.’

So she took the fiddle, and tuned it, and as she stroked the strings a
most wonderful sound was heard. Then the woodman went home, and the old
woman followed, and they both waited till they heard the woodman’s wife
approaching. At length they heard the sound of steps, and presently she
came in view, dancing merrily through the forest. When she came up to the
hut, she said: ‘Dear friends, what a wonderful music that is! I have been
following it, and I never could have found my way home without it.’ Then
the old woman said to her: ‘Pray sit down and rest yourself, and tell me
what you have seen in the forest.’ ‘Oh,’ said she, ‘I have seen the most
wonderful things! I have seen a fox, and a wolf, and a stag, and a goat,
and a wild boar, all sitting and eating out of one dish, and nobody
interfering with another’s share.’ ‘That is wonderful,’ said the old woman,
‘but come in, and tell me more.’ ‘Well,’ continued the wife, ‘I went
nearer to look at them, and they let me sit down and eat with them, and
the dish was so big, and they were so polite, that I ate and ate, till at
last I could eat no more, and then I got upon my feet to go home, but I
could not find my way, and I have been wandering about ever since.’ ‘Well,
wife,’ said the woodman, ‘you must work hard for us, and help us in the
garden and the house, as my boy and my little girl will do.’ ‘With all my
heart,’ said she, ‘I will work as hard"

","The Snow Queen

In a land far, far away, there lived a good and kind old man named Klaes. He had once been a great sorcerer, but he had long since given up his magic wand and spent his time in peace and quiet, making beautiful pictures on the windows of his cottage.

One day, as he was working at his window, a sharp piece of glass fell from the frame and cut his finger. As he gazed sorrowfully at the drop of blood that welled up, he happened to look through the window, and saw a dazzlingly beautiful sight. The sun was shining brightly, and the rays fell upon a myriad of little particles that were dancing and whirling in the air. ‘What a host of fairies!’ said the old man. ‘They must have brought me that piece of glass as a present, for it was a very fine one.’ Then he raised his head and called out: ‘Good fairies, in return for this beautiful gift, I wish one thing. I want a wife.’

Scarcely were the words out of his mouth, when a fairy came to the window, and tapped at it with her finger. Klaes looked at her, and she seemed to him to be even more beautiful than the sun itself. ‘You have only to wish,’ said she, ‘and your wish is fulfilled.’ Then Klaes looked round him, and saw a beautiful young woman standing in the room. ‘She is not quite so beautiful as the fairy,’ thought he; ‘but she is very pretty, and I have no doubt she will please me.’

He got up and went to meet her, and as he took her hand she said: ‘My name is Gerda, and the fairy has told me that I must love whoever has won me; so I will love you.’

So they were married, and lived happily together for a long time. But one day, when the sun was shining with great brilliance, a small splinter of glass from the window fell into the room, and wounded Gerda’s eye. In an instant she became ice-cold, and her face took on a pale and foreign aspect. ‘Alas!’ she cried, ‘all the world looks so strange to me! I cannot stay with you any longer.’

Then she went away, and Klaes followed her, but he could not overtake her, for she soon got so far away that he could no longer see her. ‘I know not what sorceress has bewitched her,’ said he; ‘yet I will follow her, and bring her back, or die in the attempt.’

So he journeyed on through a land of snow and ice, and the cold grew so great that his blood became frozen, and he was turned into an old man once more. Thus he continued for many years, and at last he came to a palace of crystal, where he saw a most beautiful room, and in the middle of it stood Gerda, looking quite happy. But when she saw Klaes she started with dread, and said: ‘I thought you were dead long since; for I have been with the Snow Queen.’

Then the old man told her how he had followed her, and how he had suffered for her sake, and how he still would suffer, if only she would go back with him. But she said: ‘I cannot go away from the Snow Queen; for she is so much more powerful than you, that she can make the sun stand still whenever she likes. I can stay here with her as long as I please, and when I grow tired I can go out and sit upon the snow, and look round at the world.’

While they were thus speaking, the Snow Queen came in, and said: ‘I have been out upon the snow, and have ridden upon a comet, and have seen the most beautiful stars in the world. Come with me, and you shall see them too.’

Then she took Gerda by the hand, and led her forth, and Klaes followed them. The Snow Queen said: ‘I am so glad that you have come, that I have had my palace of crystal heated, so that it is not colder here than it is in summer at home.’

So they went out upon the snow together, and the Snow Queen took Gerda upon her sledge, and Klaes followed behind. Then the Snow Queen said: ‘I am going to take you to my palace, that you may see it.’ So they went on through the night, over the snow and the ice, till at length they came to a beautiful palace made of snow and glass. And the Snow Queen said to Gerda: ‘You shall live here with me.’

But Klaes besought her with tears in his eyes, and said: ‘Pray let Gerda go, for she is my wife, and I will take care of her.’ ‘No,’ said the Snow Queen, ‘she shall never go back to you.’

Then Klaes begged so hard that she became angry, and said: ‘Very well, she shall go with you; but you must do what I tell you.’ ‘What do I have to do?’ said he. ‘Every year’s end, when the ravens are calling, you must go out upon the snow, and look for me; and when you find me, you must bow down and say: “I am the queen of the world; I rule over sun, moon, and stars; I must have the most beautiful red-bird in the world, and it shall sing in my right hand, and in my left hand shall sit the white dove, which brings the souls of the dead to heaven.” When you have said this, I will let Gerda go.’

Then the Snow Queen let Gerda go, and as the old man looked at her she seemed to be quite herself again, and she threw her arms round his neck, and said: ‘Now, indeed, I am happy.’

And Klaes took her home to his cottage, where they lived in joy and contentment for many years. And every year’s end, when the ravens were calling, he went out upon the snow, and looked for the Snow Queen, and bowed down to her, and said: ‘I am the queen of the world; I rule over sun, moon, and stars; I must have the most beautiful red-bird in the world, and it shall sing in my right hand, and in my left hand shall sit the white dove, which brings the souls of the dead to heaven.’

And the Snow Queen said: ‘He does all that I ask; I cannot help setting him free.’"

","There was once a shepherd who had a faithful dog, called Sultan, that was very
old, and had lost all his teeth. His master had now begun to think of getting
rid of him, as he did not think he was of much use any longer; but Sultan still
remained at the bottom of the hill where the flock fed, and slept under the
hedge close by, and was as faithful as ever.

One day the shepherd took his stand upon a hill, and the dog, seeing the
flock was safe, went to sleep; but the shepherd soon called out, ‘Sultan! Sultan!
awake, the sheep are running away!’ The dog started, and saw the whole
flock was gone, and a few lambs were straggling down the hill. ‘Alas!’ said he,
‘what shall I do?’ So he began to run after them as fast as he could, barking
loud, and making the best of his way down the hill.

The sheep, seeing the old dog coming, soon left off running, and began to
stand still, and one by one they began to turn round and face the dog, till
all were facing one way. Then Sultan came up to them, and bit one of them
in the tail, and away he ran with all his might, barking loud, over hill and
dale, till he had run about a hundred yards, when he stopped and called out,
‘Stop, stop!’ Then the sheep that he had bitten in the tail, and all the rest
that were with it, stopped, but all the rest kept running away over the
hill. Sultan came back to them, and bit another sheep in the tail, and away
he ran again, barking as loud as he could; and when he had run about a hundred
yards, and called out, ‘Stop, stop!’ that sheep and all that were with it
stopped, but the others kept running away. This happened a third time; and
then all the sheep that were left stood still, for all the sheep that were run
down were those that had been the most forward in running away.

Then the old dog sat down among them, and when he had rested himself a while,
he began to bark again, and all the sheep began to run away over the hill.
But Sultan let them run, till they had all gone, and then he called out,
‘Stop, stop!’ and all turned round and faced him.

So now the old dog knew that all the flock was together again; and he began
to bark as merry a bark as ever he could, and wagged his tail, and jumped
and danced for joy, and then began to run round and round among them, and
nipped here and nipped there, but bit nobody. And now the sheep were all
safe, and the shepherd came and brought them back to the fold. Then the old
dog jumped up and licked the shepherd’s face, and wagged his tail, as happy
as could be. ‘Well, Sultan,’ said the shepherd, ‘you have been true to me, and
I will be true to you; so you shall live and be well taken care of, and have
food enough, and rest enough, and be well taken care of, till I see fit to take
you to your long home.’ ‘Amen!’ said the dog, which, as you perhaps do not
know, means ‘So be it.’ And from this time forward the old shepherd took
better care of his faithful friend, and gave him plenty of food, and let him
lie and sleep whenever he pleased, and took good care of him till the end of
his days.

","There was once a poor old woman who had nothing to live upon but one little pot of lard. She was very fond of her lard, and used to sit looking at it, and saying, ‘Will it not be a pity if that should be gone?’ Now, one day, she left the house, and took the pot of lard with her, that she might not be tempted to use it. She did not lock up the house, but put the key into her apron pocket, and took the pot of lard in her hand. As she crossed the field, a little dumpling, that could speak and move, said to her, ‘Where are you going to take that pot of lard, old woman?’ ‘I am taking it with me,’ said she, ‘because I should be sure to use it if I left it at home.’ ‘If you will give me a drop, every now and then, as you walk along, I shall be very much obliged to you,’ said the dumpling. ‘Be quiet,’ said the old woman, ‘you are not my only companion; I have a great many more to look after.’ Then she gave the dumpling a little of the lard, and went on, saying to herself, ‘You must not use the lard, or you will repent it.’

As she crossed the field, a little piece of rag, that could also speak and move, said, ‘Where are you going to take that pot of lard, old woman?’ ‘I am taking it with me,’ said she, ‘because I should be sure to use it if I left it at home.’ ‘If you will give me a little of it every now and then, as you go along, I shall be very much obliged to you,’ said the piece of rag. ‘Be quiet,’ said the old woman, ‘you are not the only one; I have many more to look after.’ Then she gave the piece of rag a little of the lard, and went on muttering, ‘You must not use the lard, or you will repent it.’

As she crossed the field, a little bone, that could also speak and move, said, ‘Where are you going to take that pot of lard, old woman?’ ‘I am taking it with me,’ said she, ‘because I should be sure to use it if I left it at home.’ ‘If you will give me a little of it every now and then, as you go along, I shall be very much obliged to you,’ said the bone. ‘Be quiet,’ said the old woman, ‘you are not the only one; I have many more to look after.’ Then she gave the bone a little of the lard, and went on muttering, ‘You must not use the lard, or you will repent it.’

As she crossed the field, a little piece of string, that could also speak and move, said, ‘Where are you going to take that pot of lard, old woman?’ ‘I am taking it with me,’ said she, ‘because I should be sure to use it if I left it at home.’ ‘If you will give me a little of it every now and then, as you go along, I shall be very much obliged to you,’ said the piece of string. ‘Be quiet,’ said the old woman, ‘you are not the only one; I have many more to look after.’ Then she gave the piece of string a little of the lard, and went on muttering, ‘You must not use the lard, or you will repent it.’

At last she came to a little house, and thought she would rest there for a while. ‘Here, you may remain,’ said she to the dumpling, ‘till I come back,’ and set it down on a shelf; then she did the same with the piece of rag, the bone, and the piece of string. ‘Now, I shall have some rest,’ said she; and she sat herself by the fire and warmed herself, and took the pot of lard with her, and said, ‘I will not use you, I will not use you.’

But she could not help giving a little drop now and then into the fire, to make the flames burn more brightly; and every time she did so, her heart grew lighter within her, and she felt as if a great burden was taken from her. At last, when the pot was nearly empty, she said, ‘I will give you one drop more, fire, and then not another.’ Then she gave it to her, and the fire blazed up, and the old woman’s heart leapt within her, and all her troubles seemed to be taken away, and she felt light-hearted and happy. ‘I am rich indeed,’ said she, ‘with this little pot of lard gone, and my heart so light within me.’ So she jumped up, and danced for joy, and the old house rang again with her merry laugh.

Then she took out her key, and opened the door, and went out, and gathered together her dumpling, and her piece of rag, and her bone, and her piece of string, and took them all with her, and said, ‘I will not use you, I will not use you.’

When she came to a river she could not pass over it, for she was very old, so she said, ‘Ho! ho! here you go, my five friends, help me over.’ Then the dumpling said, ‘We will be a bridge.’ So the piece of rag laid himself across as a bridge, and the bone threw himself across, one on each side of the rag, and straightened himself out stiff as a rod. Then the piece of string hung across over the top of them, and shook itself right tight, so that none of them could move, and the old woman walked safely over, and then they drew themselves up, one after another, into a straight line, as stiff as a rod, and the old woman came back, and took them up one by one, saying, ‘I will not use you, I will not use you.’

When she came to a hill that was too high for her to climb, she said, ‘Ho! ho! here you go, my five friends, help me up.’ Then the dumpling said, ‘We will be a steps.’ So the piece of rag laid himself across as steps, one above another, and the bone threw himself across, one on each side of the rag, and stretched himself out stiff as a rod, and the piece of string hung across over the top of them, and shook itself right tight, so that none of them could move, and the old woman climbed up, step by step, and then they drew themselves up, one after another, into a straight line, as stiff as a rod, and the old woman came back, and took them up one by one, saying, ‘I will not use you, I will not use you.’

When she came to a castle, she said, ‘Ho! ho! here you go, my five friends, help me into the castle.’ Then the dumpling said, ‘We will be a ladder.’ So the piece of rag laid himself across as steps, one above another, hard by the wall, and the bone threw himself across, one on each side of the rag, and stretched himself out stiff as a rod, and the piece of string hung across over the top of them, and shook itself right tight, so that none of them could move, and the old woman climbed up, step by step, and then they drew themselves up, one after another, into a straight line, as stiff as a rod, and the old woman came back, and took them up one by one, saying, ‘I will not use you, I will not use you.’

Then she looked about the castle, and saw a young king sitting in the hall; and he was so handsome that her heart leapt within her, and she went up to him, and took his hand, and said, ‘I am the most beautiful princess in the world.’ ‘How can that be?’ said the king; ‘I have the most beautiful princess in the world here with me.’ ‘Not I?’ said the old woman; ‘look, and judge between us.’ Then the king looked,"

","The Snow Queen

In a village in Norway, there lived a tailor named Kai. He was a good
tailor, and made the best clothes in all the land. But he was very proud of
his skill, and would say: ‘I am the best workman in the world.’ One day
a stranger came to the village. He was an old man, with a long white
beard, and he looked wise. Kai told him boastfully that he could make
any kind of cloths. ‘Your work may be very fine,’ said the old man, ‘but
not as fine as the snowflakes which fall from the heavens.’ ‘What!’
cried Kai, ‘cannot I make my work as fine as the snowflakes?’ ‘Certainly
not,’ said the old man; ‘go out and look.’ Then Kai went out, and the
old man took a feather from his cap and sprinkled the snow with it. When
Kai came back, the old man said: ‘Look sharp, and see if there is not one
snowflake exactly like another.’ Then Kai looked, and thought he should
never find two alike, and he became very sad and troubled, and said: ‘How
can I call myself a workman, when even the snowflakes are finer than my
work?’

As he was thus thinking, a dazzlingly beautiful girl came in. It was the
Snow Queen. ‘Do not grieve, Kai,’ said she; ‘I will soon set you free
from all your troubles. Here is a shred of my frost-silk; weave me a
little shirt with it, and cut me out a suit of clothes.’ Then Kai looked
at the shred of silk, and it was so fine that the smallest snowflake
seemed coarse and clumsy by the side of it. Still he tried to weave the
shirt, but in vain; the silk was too slippery and fine for his clumsy
fingers.

Meanwhile the Snow Queen went out, and the tailor was left alone. He
began to be uneasy, and said to himself: ‘What if the beautiful girl
should never come back?’ So he determined to weave a shirt for her, and
cut out a suit of clothes, without waiting for her order. When it was
ready he laid it on his table, and it was so fine that words are not
enough to tell how beautiful it was. Then he went out to look for the
Snow Queen, but she was gone. He searched the whole village, but she was
not to be found. At last he went out of the country, and travelled over
sea and land, looking for her, but in vain. He asked the birds of the
air, the beasts of the field, and the fishes of the sea, if they had
seen his beloved one; but they shook their heads, and said, ‘We know
her not.’

At last he came to the Palace of the Snow Queen, which was in the
heavens. There he hoped to find her; but when he got there, all the
people gazed upon him, and said: ‘Who is this? He is not like us.’ Then
they took him before the judge, who said: ‘This man is not like us; he
is not made of ice and snow like we are; therefore he must leave our
neighbourhood.’

Kai begged so hard to be allowed to stay, that they at last said he might
go and look for the Snow Queen, and bring her to them if he could find
her. So he went forth again on his journey, and sought for the Snow
Queen through the world, over sea and land, in the summer and in the
winter, in the day-time and in the night-time; but she was not to be
found. Then he began to be very sad, and thought he should never see her
again.

One day, as he was wandering through a strange country, he saw a little
boy sitting under a tree, and close by the boy there was a burnt-out
cinder glowing red-hot. The boy was picking up pebbles and throwing them
at the cinder, but they only hissed and fizzled, and flew back again.
Then Kai said to him, ‘What are you doing?’ ‘I am trying,’ said the boy,
‘to kill that cinder; but it is no use, for it always lives again and
becomes hot again.’ ‘How stupid!’ said Kai; ‘why do you try to kill it?
It is only a cinder, and will do you no harm.’ ‘Oh! yes, it has done me
great harm,’ said the boy; ‘for it burnt my leg so that I could not sit
or walk, till it healed; and now it has burnt me again.’

Kai took the boy upon his knee, and said: ‘Tell me, who burnt your leg
the first time?’ ‘The old woman did,’ answered the boy, ‘who lives in
the nut-tree.’ ‘And what has the Snow Queen to do with the matter?’ said
Kai. ‘Ah!’ said the boy, ‘the old woman took me away from my home, and
carried me with her into the nut-tree; and there she burnt my leg on the
cinder, and then set me to watch the nuts, so that no one might take
them away. And now she has taken away all my marbles, and all my pretty
things, and has threatened that if I do not work hard and watch well,
she will burn me again.’

Kai said: ‘I will soon set you free.’ Then he took a hatchet, and cut down
the nut-tree, and the old woman who was in it, fell down dead. He took
the boy home with him, and they travelled on together.

One day they came to a palace made of card-houses, and the roof and all
were so high that they could not reach it. ‘This must be the dwelling of
the Snow Queen,’ said Kai; ‘but how can we get in?’ Then the boy said:
‘I know how we can get in.’ He fetched a little piece of marsh allow,
and set fire to it; then they went to work, and set fire to the palace,
and when the flames had burnt away a part of it, they went in.

In one of the rooms they found a little girl, who was so beautiful that
Kai had never seen any one so beautiful. She was gazing upon her own
image in a looking-glass, and did not see them come in. ‘That must be
the Snow Queen,’ said Kai; ‘has not her face the most beautiful of any
you have ever seen?’ ‘Yes,’ said the boy, ‘but look at her eyes.’ Then
Kai looked, and saw that each eye was full of pins. ‘I must take care of
that,’ said he; ‘I will shut her into a cage, so that she cannot do any
harm.’ So he made a cage of twigs, and shut her in it, and they took
her with them.

They journeyed on through a country where it was always winter, and
snowed and blew hard. At last they came to a palace made of ice and snow,
and there the Snow Queen lived. When she saw Kai she was very glad, and
said: ‘Now at last I am safe, and you cannot escape me.’ But Kai said:
‘I have brought the little boy with me, who knows all about you; and
here is the little girl, who is so beautiful, but has pins in her eyes;
and here is the old woman who burnt the little boy; and here is the
nut-tree; and here is the marsh allow with which we burnt the palace.’
Then he showed her all his trophies.

","There was once a poor woodman, who cut wood in the forest, and lived with his wife in a little cottage upon the outskirts of the same. They had one child, a daughter, who was very pretty, and had eyes like the prettiest blue flowers in the forest, and a nose like a cherry, and lips like the berries upon the rose-bush, and a neck as white and dainty as a swan’s. The woodman and his wife loved their little daughter very much, and were very happy when they looked at her; but often when they looked at each other they were very sorrowful, for they had no money to buy her anything to wear.

One day the woodman cut too deep, and the axe fell and wounded him so that he lay ill for many weeks. His wife watched by him day and night, but they had no money to buy food, and soon all they had in the world was spent. Then the little daughter went into the forest and gathered nuts and berries, till she was very thin and pale; and when the woodman got better he was very sorrowful to see how his little daughter looked.

One day he said, ‘I will cut myself no more wood, but will sit by the cottage door and watch the highway that leads by our house, and if I see any traveller going the way the little girl shall go and beg a penny’s worth of bread for me.’

Now as he sat there, he saw a little dwarf, about half as high as a man, and as thin as a rush, and looking quite ruddy and rolly-poly, and merry. The dwarf had a small red cloak on, and a hat with a feather in it, and a little gun slung round his neck, and a bow and arrows at his back. ‘Well, well,’ said the dwarf, ‘what’s your business, man?’ ‘I am very ill,’ said the woodman. ‘That’s a pity. What ails you?’ ‘My little girl has been into the forest and gathered nuts and berries till she is all thin and pale, and I had to lie ill for want of food, and now we are very poor and have nothing to eat.’ ‘Well,’ said the dwarf, ‘I will soon set all that right. I like your little daughter very much, so I’ll do as you wish, and come every day, and bring your little girl a basket of nuts and berries, so that she shall never be able to carry them all away. But in return for that I am to have a little room in the cottage, and you must let me do as I please in it, and never go in there, or take it away from me.’ ‘Anything, anything,’ said the woodman, ‘so that we may have bread to eat.’ ‘Very well,’ said the dwarf; ‘my people shall take care of you, and I myself will come every day and bring your little girl a basket of nuts and berries.’

So the little dwarf was true to his word, and every day the little girl looked for him, and he came trotting along, and then they were always well supplied with nuts and berries. And the dwarf took up his abode in the little room, and the woodman and his wife never went in there, and did not even speak of it.

The little girl grew prettier and plumper every day, for now she always had something to eat; and when her father was strong enough to work again, they were better off than they had ever been before, for the dwarf brought the nuts and berries every day.

Now it happened that the little girl was walking in the forest alone one day, and the dwarf was not coming as usual, so she waited for him a long while, but he stayed away. And it grew dark, and she did not like to go home alone, so she went into a little hut that she had never seen before, to spend the night there. And as she was going to light herself a fire, she saw a queer little old woman sitting in the corner. ‘Why, where are you from, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘From home,’ said the little girl. ‘Where do you live, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘In the wood.’ ‘With whom, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘With my father and mother.’ ‘What are you doing, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘Going to light myself a fire.’ ‘What are you going to do when the fire is lit?’ said the old woman. ‘To sit and warm myself.’ ‘What are you going to do after you have warmed yourself?’ said the old woman. ‘To go home.’ ‘Where do you live, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘In the wood.’ ‘With whom, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘With my father and mother.’ ‘What are you going to do when you get home, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘To lie down and go to sleep.’ ‘Where do you sleep, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘In our bed.’ ‘What are you going to do after you have lain down and gone to sleep?’ said the old woman. ‘To get up in the morning.’ ‘Where are you going to go when you get up in the morning, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘To the forest to gather wood with my father.’ ‘What are you going to do with the wood, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘To burn it in the fire.’ ‘What are you going to do after you have burned it in the fire, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘To sit and turn it into cookies and cakes.’ ‘Where are you going to put the cookies and cakes, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘In the cupboard.’ ‘What are you going to do with the cookies and cakes in the cupboard, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘To eat them.’ ‘Where are you going to eat them, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘At the table.’ ‘What are you going to do after you have eaten the cookies and cakes, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘To work with my mother.’ ‘What are you going to do with the work, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘To hang it up in the chimney corner.’ ‘What are you going to do with it when it is hung up in the chimney corner, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘To go to bed and sleep.’ ‘What are you going to do after you have gone to bed and slept, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘To get up in the morning.’ ‘What are you going to do when you get up in the morning, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘To go with my father to the forest to cut wood.’ ‘What are you going to do with the wood, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘To burn it in the fire.’ ‘What are you going to do after you have burnt it in the fire, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘To sit and turn it into cookies and cakes.’ ‘Where are you going to put the cookies and cakes, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘In the cupboard.’ ‘What are you going to do with the cookies and cakes in the cupboard, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘To eat them.’ ‘Where are you going to eat them, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘At the table.’ ‘What are you going to do after you have eaten the cookies and cakes, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘To work with my mother.’ ‘What are you going to do with the work, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘To hang it up in the chimney corner.’ ‘What are you going to do with it when it is hung up in the chimney corner, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘To go to bed and sleep.’ ‘What are you going to do after you have gone to bed and slept, pretty child?’ said the old woman. ‘To get up in the morning.’ ‘What are"

","There was once a man who had a daughter that was very fair and comely, but so proud that no prince would marry her. Then said her father: ‘I will give you for husband the first man that will come to meet us on our way out of the wood.’ They were just going out of the wood, when a frog put his head out of the water and said: ‘I am a prince, and I say that you shall marry me.’ Then the girl was very angry, and threw her girdle (belt) after him, and said: ‘Take that, you frog, you will never see me again!’ But the frog caught it, and jumped on to the land, and laid himself down and seemed very sorrowful.

The prince had really been enchanted by a witch, and the girdle was the only thing that could free him. As soon as he had it he became a handsome man, and went to the king, and asked for the princess for his wife. The king was unwilling, but when the prince said that he would show him the girdle, he was forced to give his daughter. But the frog had laid the spell so that the princess should never be happy unless she did everything he wished.

One day he said she must go with him into the garden, and there pluck the berries from the red-cap and white-cap bushes. The red-cap bushes were close together, and the white-cap were far apart, so she was obliged to leave some of the white berries. Then she thought to herself: ‘If I bring home all, my lord will be angry, and if I do not, he will be angry, so I had better let him be angry.’ But when she came home, and the prince saw that she had not plucked all the white berries, he was very angry indeed, and said: ‘You shall not eat or drink anything for seven years.’

Then the princess went away to a wood, and there she saw a beautiful white snowflake, which had seven rays from each of its petals. She thought to herself: ‘That is a very pretty flower, I will take it with me, and wear it in my hair when I go home.’ But as she was just going to pluck it, the snowflower said: ‘Take me not away, I foresee great trouble for you; if you do so, you will repent it. Seven years must you tarry, and then you will be three months on the way home; you will have a hungry and thirsty child, and will be obliged to give it milk, but you will have none; you will be forced to give it your blood to drink, or it will die. Seven men will come to you, each more noble than the other, offering to marry you, but you must refuse them all; the eighth will be the prince to whom you belonged, and he alone will be able to save you.’ But the princess would not listen to the snowflower, and plucked it, and took it with her.

When the seven years were come, and she was three months on the way home, she began to feel what the snowflower had foretold. She was very hungry and thirsty, and her child was worse off still; it cried to her and said: ‘Give me milk, oh, give me milk!’ But she had none to give, and said: ‘If I give you my blood you will live, for I have no milk.’ Then she took her pin and pricked her finger, and her blood ran into a bowl, and she gave it to her child to drink, and it lived.

Soon after, she saw seven men in the path, each more noble than the other, riding on horses, and they rode up to her, and one after another offered to marry her. But she knew that she must not, and said: ‘I will not.’ At last the eighth came, and he was still more noble and handsome than the others, and he said: ‘I am the prince who was once a frog, and I say that you must marry me.’ Then she knew that it was her old prince, who had been enchanted, and she fell at his feet, and said: ‘O, spare me, I will do all you wish, only grant me that I may go to my father’s court, and there I will stay till I please.’ Then the prince said: ‘Yes, you may go thither, but you must let the king see that you are happy, and that you have children, so give me a child.’ Then she had a child, and it was the snowflower, which had been changed into a girl.

So she went to the court, and the king saw that she was happy, and that she had a child, and said: ‘Who is the father of this child?’ Then she said: ‘It is the snowflower, which I found in the wood, and which has been changed into a girl.’ And the king said: ‘Bring me the snowflower, that I may see it.’ But she knew not how to find it, and was very uneasy; and the prince was also uneasy, and said: ‘If the king asks for me, you must say that you know me not.’

But the snowflower, who really was the princess’s daughter, soon found out what was passing, and came to her mother, and said: ‘Why did you say that you did not know me? Pray take me for your servant, and say to the king that I am your daughter.’ Then the princess did so, and the king was well pleased, and said: ‘Let her have the kingdom with her.’

The prince wished to go home to his wife, but she begged him to let her stay with her father and daughter a while longer. At last he said: ‘I will stay a year longer,’ but the next year came not, for he married her again, and lived happily with her to the end of his days.

","There was once a man who had a horse that had been faithful to him a long time,
but was now growing old and could no longer be used for riding or pulling. So
the man said, ‘I will kill him, and make a fine saddle out of his skin.’

The horse, who could understand everything that was said, was very much
frightened at the thought of being killed, and began to paw the ground with
his right front foot, and to kick with his left hind one, so violently that the
man was forced to hold him. ‘Why do you make such a commotion?’ said he. ‘I
am going to make a fine saddle out of your skin.’ ‘Do as you will,’ said the
horse, ‘only let me have my liberty for two hours longer, and then you may
do with me as you please.’ ‘Where shall I turn you loose?’ asked the man.
‘In the meadow that belongs to my master the miller.’ ‘All right,’ said the
man; ‘you shall have your liberty there till evening.’

As soon as the horse was turned loose, he trotted off at once to the miller’s
house, and said to his wife, ‘I know that I am to die this evening, and I
should like to spend the little time that is left to me in listening to some
good stories. Do pray tell me one.’ ‘Where do you come from, you silly beast?’
said the woman. ‘Tell me a German fairy tale.’ ‘I am not in the mood for
story-telling,’ said the woman. ‘If you don’t tell me a story, I shall be forced
to tell you a bad joke.’ ‘Well, well,’ said the woman, ‘since you choose, I
will tell you a German fairy tale.’

‘There was once a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run
alone. Every day the child asked her mother to take her into the garden, but
the mother always said, ‘Not now, I am too busy,’ till at last the little
girl, in her impatience to run about, pushed open the door and ran away.
The mother was very grieved, and went in search of the child, but she could
not find her; and she cried so much over her loss that her tears fell like
rain. At last, after seeking her in vain, she went home, and sat down in
her chair, and could eat nothing, and slept neither at night nor during the
day. So her people sent for a famous doctor, who soon found out what was the
matter, and said, ‘The queen must never again see her daughter, or she will
die.’

The doctor’s words were soon fulfilled. One day the little girl went into the
garden, and gathered some flowers, and laid them in a dish and carried it
to her mother. The queen saw them, and thought they were roses, and took
them in her hand, and at once fell fainting to the ground. When she came to
herself she was very sorry that she had seen her child, and vowed that she
would never do so again as long as she lived.

Some time after this, the queen held a great feast, and asked all the nobles
and knights of the land to come and eat and drink with her. One of these
nobles was called the Knight of the Burning Sword, because his sword flamed
like fire whenever he was going to fight. Another was called the Knight of
the Poisoned Sword, because whatever he struck at died instantly. A third
was called the Knight of the Golden Horse, because all his armour was of
solid gold.

Now the queen had a strange custom. When any of her guests had finished
eating, she presented him with one of her gloves, and he was not allowed to
leave the table until he had pierced it with his sword. The first three knights
who were sent away tried their swords on the glove, but all in vain; for the
leather was so thick that it bent without breaking. Then the queen became
angry, and threw the gloves on the ground, and said, ‘You are a worthless set
of knights, and not worthy to be called so; you shall perish one and all!’
and she sent her servants to kill them. But they set their palaces on fire,
and rode forth at the head of their followers, and laid waste all the land
round about.

The king sent out spies to find out where the knights were going to make their
next attack. The spies soon came back and said, ‘They are going to the sun.’
‘Can you find out what they want there?’ said the king. ‘No,’ answered the
spies; ‘but we saw three old men by the gate of the city, who seemed to be
arguing about the best way of yoking a cow to a plough.’

When the king heard this he became very angry, and called his chief minister
before him, and said, ‘Go yourself and see who these old men are, and what
they want, and find out what the knights want by the sun.’ The minister took
horse therefore, and rode away in the direction the spies had taken. After
he had gone a little way he came to a great wood, and in the wood he came to
a valley, and by the side of the valley there was a little cottage. In front
of the cottage he saw three old men sitting together, and they seemed to be
in a great dispute. One said, ‘I am sure that the cow ought to be harnessed
with the horn on the right side.’ ‘No,’ said the second, ‘the horn ought to
be on the left.’ ‘Mind your own business,’ said the third; ‘I am the one who
is to work the cow.’ The minister listened to all they said, and then went on
his way. Soon afterwards he came to the sun, and close by the sun he saw the
three knights. ‘What do you want by the sun?’ said he. ‘We are cooling
ourselves,’ said they; ‘the heat is so great where we live that we cannot
bear it.’ ‘What do the three old men by the valley have to say?’ asked the
king’s minister. ‘Oh, they are fools,’ said the knights; ‘they have been
arguing about the best way of harnessing a cow to a plough, and have been
quarrelling about it for half an hour.’ ‘What do they want by doing so?’ said
the minister. ‘They want to yoke the king’s colt to the plough,’ answered the
knight; ‘they think that if they could turn it out with the plough they should
have plenty of corn, and could then make themselves strong and fat.’ ‘What
a fine plot!’ said the minister; ‘they shall have their reward.’ So he went
back to the old men, and said, ‘Why do you quarrel so about turning out the
cow with the plough?’ ‘We are not quarrelling,’ said they; ‘we are only
agreeing.’ ‘You need not agree so long,’ said the minister; ‘only tell me
what you are about.’ ‘We are only deciding whether the cow ought to be
yoked with the horn on the right or on the left.’ ‘I had rather you would
not turn out the cow at all,’ said the minister; ‘the king’s colt must be
yoked instead, and you must sow all sorts of grain for him.’ ‘Oh, yes,’ said
they; ‘that will be a good plan, for the colt will then be fattened, and will
make a fine draught-horse.’

When the minister saw that they were bent on having their own way, he went
back to the knights, and said, ‘The old men have agreed to turn out the cow
with the plough, and have chosen the best grain for it to eat.’ ‘That won’t"

","Once upon a time, in a village that stood in a green and flowery land,
a long way from any other, there lived an old woman who was a witch.
And this old woman had two grandchildren, a boy and a girl, who were
beautiful and good, but very, very silly. Now the old woman had a
little casket, and in this casket there was a magical ring, that made
whosoever wore it, whatever they might wish for, that very same thing
should come to pass. And she said to her grandchildren, ‘Be careful,
and never put your hands upon my casket, or you may cost yourselves
your lives.’ But one day, when she had gone out of the village, the
boy and the girl could wait no longer to see what was in the casket;
so they took it out of the cupboard where it hung, and the girl opened
it, and gave the boy the ring. Then said the boy, ‘Now I wish that we
might be as beautiful as the sun and the moon.’ And as they spoke, the
wish came true, and they were so beautiful that the heavens themselves
seemed to have shone upon them.

Now there was a shepherd lad who often went into the village, and he
had seen the boy and the girl before they were so beautiful; so when
he saw them now, he did not know them, and thought they were angels
that had come from heaven, and he fell at their feet, and said, ‘You
must be angels; take me with you to heaven, and I will take care to do
all that you wish.’ ‘No,’ said they, ‘we are not angels; we are the
grandchildren of this old woman, but she has been away, and we have
been so foolish as to open her casket, and take out her ring; if she
catches us she will kill us.’ Then the shepherd lad said, ‘Take me with
you, and I will watch and ward over you.’ So they let him go with them,
and told him to lodge wherever they should lodge, and to pasture their
sheep wherever they should go.

After this, the three of them went to a great court, where a king held
his court, and there was great joy made, for never before had such
beautiful people been seen. And the king fell in love with the girl,
and said, ‘If you are angels, pray grant me one boon.’ ‘We will grant
you anything,’ said they, ‘only we must go home by this time tomorrow.’
Then the king said, ‘I see you are beautiful even in the moonlight;
pray let me have the power of seeing you always in the moonlight, and
not as other people.’ ‘That is easily granted,’ said they; ‘but mind
and come to the window of the castle at the full moon, and then you
will see us.’ So the king was well pleased, and they went their way.

The next day they went to a fairy castle, where a king of the fairies
held his court; and there was greater joy made than at the king’s
court, for never before had such beautiful people been seen there.
And this fairy king fell in love with the boy, and begged for one
boon. ‘Stay with us till the full moon,’ said they, ‘and then come to
the window, and you shall see us as we are.’ So the fairy king was
well pleased, and they went their way.

The third day they went to a royal court under the sea; and there was
great rejoicing, for such beautiful people had never been seen there.
And the king of the sea fell in love with the girl, and begged for one
boon. ‘Stay with us till the full moon,’ said they, ‘and then come to
the window, and you shall see us as we are.’ So the king of the sea was
well pleased, and they went their way.

When the full moon came, each of the three kings went to the window;
and lo! the beautiful people were there; and they saw the shepherd lad
standing among them. Then were they angry, and sent their armies to
seize the shepherd lad, and carry him away prisoner. But he drew a
ring off his finger, and threw it behind him; and when the soldiers
would have taken him, they could not, but were held fast, so that they
were all turned into stones.

When the shepherd lad saw this, he was very grieved, and went home to
his own country, and told all that had happened. Then the villagers
pitying him, built a church upon the spot where the ring was thrown,
and all joined in looking for it; but all in vain: and the ring was
never found, and the old witch came home, and wished that the shepherd
lad might come to her; and the charm worked, for he was soon carried
before her. Then she was very angry, and said, ‘You have been meddling
with what did not concern you, and putting your hands upon my casket;
therefore you must die.’ And she struck him with her staff, and he fell
dead upon the ground. ‘The End.’"

","There was once a poor woodman, who cut wood in the forest, and lived there
alone in a little hut with his wife. One evening, as he was sitting by the
fire, he said: ‘I will rise early tomorrow morning, and go into the forest,
and cut down a tree, and make a child’s sledge out of it for our little
Catherine.’ Then the wife said: ‘I too will rise early, and be at the
cooking before you come home, that the porridge may be ready when you
sit down to eat.’

But in the middle of the night, the woodman was awoke by a loud noise,
and heard a wolf howling, that seemed to be close by. He got up and
listened, and the howling came nearer and nearer, until at last it seemed
to come from the very door of the hut. Then the woodman was afraid, and
took his axe, and went outside, and said: ‘Who is there?’ But no one
answered, and he heard the wolf springing upon and devouring a poor
lamb that was kept by a shepherd in the forest. ‘Alas!’ said the woodman,
‘how miserable is the poor shepherd!’ and he began to cut down the little
thicket in which the wolf had been hiding himself. When the wolf saw that
he was discovered, he sprang out, and would have seized the woodman with
his teeth, if the latter had not raised his axe and struck him on the head
so hard that he fell down senseless. Then the woodman drove him with
sticks into a thicket, where he was quite sure he would not be able to get
out again, and went home to his wife, and said: ‘The Lord has helped me, and
I have killed the wolf.’

The wife was overjoyed to hear that no harm had befallen her husband, and
said: ‘The Lord be praised!’ and next morning the woodman went out to cut
down the tree for the sledge, and the wife went to the brook to draw water,
and sang as she worked:

 ‘The bear, the bear is roaming,
  O’er hill and dale he’s rambling;
  His skin so soft, his coat so warm,
  A pretty bargain for some!

 ‘The wolf, the wolf is roaming,
  O’er hill and dale he’s rambling;
  His teeth so sharp, his tongue so long,
  A pretty bargain for some!

 ‘The lion, the lion is roaming,
  O’v’r hill and dale he’s rambling;
  His claws so long, his tongue so short,
  A pretty bargain for some!

 ‘The boar, the boar is roaming,
  O’er hill and dale he’s rambling;
  His tusks so long, his eyes so small,
  A pretty bargain for some!

And while she was still singing, someone came running up to her, and cried:
‘Good woman, good woman, your husband is in danger! A bear is coming into
the forest, and wants to kill him.’ Then the wife was frightened, and let
the bucket sink into the brook, and ran home, and said to her husband:
‘Your life must not be in danger; go out no more, but finish your work at
home.’ But the woodman said: ‘You must not speak so; I will soon finish my
work, and then I will come home.’

When he had hewn down the tree, he made the sledge, and cut a nice bow,
and sharpened arrows, and fitted them to the string, and then said: ‘Now,
Catherine, I will take you out into the forest, and let you pull the sledge
along.’ Then he lifted up the little girl, and put her on the sledge, and
pushed it out, and cried: ‘Catherine, draw your sledge!’ But the bow and
the arrows lay across the sledge, and the little girl did not understand
what he wanted, and stood there and laughed. Then the woodman ran to her,
and took her up in his arms, and said: ‘You must be good, or I will punish
you.’ But as he was carrying the little girl home, there came a bear, that
had heard all about it, and was come to devour her. The woodman saw him,
and aimed at him with his bow, and let an arrow fly, but the bear caught
it in his paw, and threw it away, and ran towards the man and wanted to
seize him. The woodman ran with Catherine into the hut, and shut the door,
but the bear beat against it so violently that the locks flew into a thousand
pieces, and the door sprang open. Then the woodman took his little girl,
and ran behind a large cask that stood in the hut, and the bear came in
roaring, and looked about to see where the man was hidden. When he had
carefully searched the whole hut, and found that the man was not there,
he went out again, and wanted to break down the cask to get the man out.
But the woodman pushed the cask forward, so that it overset the bear, and
he fell upon his back, and the woodman shot an arrow into his throat.
Then he ran to his little daughter, and said: ‘Catherine, the Lord has
helped me again; the bear wants to kill your father.’

The wife heard the noise, and ran out, and when the woodman told her what
had happened, she fell on her knees before him, and said: ‘Our Lord be
praised!’ and next morning the woodman went out again into the forest to
hew wood, and the wife stayed at home with her little daughter. Then she
took the iron tongs and the shovel, and went out to the brook to draw water,
and sang:

 ‘The bear, the bear is roaming,
  O’er hill and dale he’s rambling;
  His skin so soft, his coat so warm,
  A pretty bargain for some!

 ‘The wolf, the wolf is roaming,
  O’er hill and dale he’s rambling;
  His teeth so sharp, his tongue so long,
  A pretty bargain for some!

 ‘The lion, the lion is roaming,
  O’v’r hill and dale he’s rambling;
  His claws so long, his tongue so short,
  A pretty bargain for some!

 ‘The boar, the boar is roaming,
  O’er hill and dale he’s rambling;
  His tusks so long, his eyes so small,
  A pretty bargain for some!

When she had sung this, a wolf came howling up to her, and cried: ‘Good
woman, good woman, your husband is in danger; the bear wants to kill him.’
Then she let sink the bucket into the brook, and ran home, and said: ‘Dear
husband, the wolf is howling, and wants to tell us that the bear is coming
to kill you.’ But the woodman said: ‘You must not listen to such tales; I
will soon finish my work, and then I will come home.’

When he had made a chair out of the tree, and had planed and carved it,
he took it on his back, and went home, and the wolf ran up to the wife,
and cried: ‘Good woman, good woman, your husband is in danger; the lion is
coming into the forest to kill him.’ Then the wife fell on her knees, and
prayed to God with tears in her eyes, and said: ‘Dear God, what shall I do?
What shall I do?’ The lion soon came roaring up, and cried"

","There was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter. Now this miller was a great boaster, and told everyone that his daughter could spin gold. Many people came and made her rich offers for her, but she did not care for them, for she was promised to a poor man whom she loved. At last came a king who wanted to marry her, and offered her a great fortune. Then the miller could no longer help boasting, and said that his daughter could spin gold. But the king was very angry when he found he had been so treate, and ordered the miller to be executed. The girl, seeing that she was lost, said that her father was in error, and that she could spin gold, but that she would first do it before the king. Then the king ordered a room to be got ready, and filled with all the lintels and combs that they could find in his kingdom. There she sat down and began to work, and the king waited a long time, but saw no gold. Then he became impatient, and threatened to have her executed with her father, if she did not work some gold at once. But she begged for a little time, and at last, just as the king was going out, there was a noise of rattling gold, and she had spun gold enough to fill all the combs and lintels.

When the king saw that, he was very glad, and ordered a great feast to be got ready, and thought only of enjoying himself. The poor man, who was called in, did not know what to say or do, and sat in a corner, where no one saw him. But the miller’s daughter looked at him, and said, ‘Dear sir, why are you so downcast?’ ‘Because,’ said he, ‘I see a great feast is got ready, and I have nothing to eat.’ Then she gave him a seat by her side, and they ate and drank together. When the king saw this, he became very angry, and thought that the miller’s daughter meant to steal him from his kingdom. So he ordered a great hall to be built, with seven doors, and said that if the man could find his way out of it, without the king’s people seeing him, he should have his daughter for wife. The man said nothing, but the miller’s daughter went to him, and said, ‘Dear sir, what a beautiful hall that is!’ ‘Yes,’ said he, ‘it makes me very melancholy to think that I shall never be able to find my way out of it.’ Then she said, ‘I will go in with you, and we will try.’

So they went in together through the first door; and when they came to the second door the king’s people were standing there, but they passed on unseen. And at every door the king’s people were waiting to see them, but they never saw the man and the miller’s daughter, till they came to the end of the hall. Then the king was very angry, and said that they had seen someone in the hall, and had only gone out through a back door, and that they should be executed next morning. But the miller’s daughter begged for one more night’s grace, and the king let her have it, though with a bad will. Then she went to her dear friend, and said, ‘Alas! what are we to do?’ ‘Do not grieve,’ said he; ‘I will soon find a way.’

The next day, when it came to be executed, the miller’s daughter was so beautiful, that the king could not find it in his heart to have her killed. So he ordered a great fire to be made in the middle of the town square, and said that he would let her off if she could, by the end of the day, find out what it was that ate the ground about the town and destroyed all the crops. Then the miller’s friend went away with her, and she begged him to tell her what she should say. ‘Tell them,’ said he, ‘that it is an old nail which the carpenters have driven into the earth, and which wants to be drawn out.’ Then the king’s people laughed and scoffed at her, and said that it was a silly thing to say, and that it was not an old nail, but something much more terrible than that.

But when day broke the miller’s friend went to the king, and said, ‘If the miller’s daughter has told the truth, let her live, and if not, let her be executed.’ Then the king sent for the carpenters, and they came and brought their tools, and drove a nail into the ground, and there was such a noise and rushing about, that all the king’s people were terrified, and ran away. And when the miller’s friend and the king came back, they found the miller’s daughter sitting under a tree, and she said, ‘Why do you make such a fuss? I see that it is all over.’ ‘What do you mean?’ said the king. ‘Why,’ said she, ‘I see that the carpenters have driven the nail in too deep, and that they are going to pull it out with a chisel.’ Then the king was so angry that he ordered her to be executed on the spot.

But her friend went away, and again came back in the evening, and begged the king to give her one more night’s grace. ‘No,’ said the king; ‘it is of no use, for she has had three days already, and tomorrow shall be executed.’ ‘Then,’ said the friend, ‘she must die.’

The king would not listen to him, but went away. Then the friend went to the miller’s daughter, and said, ‘All is over; the king has said that you must die.’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘what shall I do?’ ‘Marry me,’ said he, ‘and sit in the coach with me, and we will soon leave this country behind us.’ Then she said, ‘I will do all you say,’ and in the evening, when it was dark, she went with her friend into the coach, and they drove away.

The king, who was waiting to see them go, thought he should like to know where they were going, and what was their business, so he got into his coach and overtook them. Then he asked them where they were going, and what they had to do. ‘We are going,’ said the friend, ‘to a wedding.’ ‘May I go too?’ said the king. ‘Oh, yes,’ said the other; ‘but let us have some music.’ Then the coachman put his finger to his lips, and said, ‘Hush! we must not speak, or the bride will hear us.’

When they came to the wedding, a great many torches were lit up, and the king got down and followed the friend into the room where the bride was. ‘I am so sorry,’ said he, ‘but I have lost my way, and do not know where my coach is standing.’ ‘I will go with you,’ said the bride. So they went out together, and the king took her by the hand. But when they came to the coach, the friend pushed the king away, and said, ‘That is our coach,’ and jumped in, and drove off with the bride.

The king was left standing in the middle of the road, and he did not know where to go or what to do. Then he saw afar off some torches moving about, and went up to them, and found that it was the bride’s train going to a feast. So he begged to be allowed to go in, and when he was seated, he could not help thinking of the bride who had slipped away from him.

Suddenly, as he was eating, one of the plates slipped from his hand and fell, and there was a noise as if a gun had been fired. Then everyone started, and looked round to see what was the matter, and the bride said, ‘I know somebody here!’ ‘You must be mistaken,’ said the king; ‘there is nobody here that I know.’ But the bride said, ‘I am quite sure that I know someone.’"

","There was once a poor old woman who lived in a hut with her only child,
a daughter named Hansel. ‘Alas!’ she said to herself, ‘how can I feed
both you and yourself? You are getting fat, and I am growing thinner.
An idea came into her head. ‘I have it,’ she said to herself. ‘I will take
Hansel into the forest, where I will leave him alone, and he will never
find his way home again, and then I shall be rid of him, and have the
little money which he earns for our maintenance, to spend as I like.’

She was very crafty, and thought she knew a good plan. It was near the
time when the ripe grain was binding itself into ears, and she said to
Hansel: ‘Into the field take this little basketful of rolls, and when you
have eaten them, you will get hungry again, and then you will eat the
ripe grain, and your belly will be full. I will tell the man with the
axe that you are going to do so, and that you are to be beaten for it.
You will then howl, and that will be a merry joke. I should not like to
be your mother.’

The wicked woman’s heart was lighter as she thus cruelly abandoned her
own child in the forest. Hansel, however, who was still young and
simple-hearted, had not thought of all this, and when his mother had gone
out of sight, he said: ‘I know that my mother has forsaken me, and is not
sorry that I am going to die of hunger, but I will not let myself die. I
must think of something.’ Then he looked around him, and saw a little
piece of roll still lying in the basket, and said: ‘I will not eat this
at home, but will save it, and when I am hungry I will eat it.’ So he took
the roll with him, and walked on in the direction of the forest.

When he reached the outskirts, he looked around him and above him, and
behold! the sun shone brightly through the branches of the trees, and
the birds were singing so merrily that he felt glad and light-hearted.
He walked on still farther, and as he was very hungry, he ate his little
piece of roll.

‘Now,’ thought he, ‘if I am to die here, I had better look for a place
where I shall be as safe as possible.’ He walked on a short time longer,
and then saw a bed of rushes in a sunny spot in the forest, so he cleared
away the dry branches, and laid the green braid of rushes nice and
straight, and then said: ‘If I am to die here, at least I shall have a
proper resting-place.’ Then he looked around him again, and saw that the
little roll was gone, and did not even know that he had eaten it.

He felt very hungry indeed now, but he did not care for that, and lay
down in the bed of rushes, and fell asleep. When he awoke it was already
dark night. ‘I must find some food at once,’ thought he, ‘or I shall die
of hunger.’ He looked around him, but could see nothing but the forest
around him. Then he went on feeling about with his hands, and after a
while his fingers met something hard and round. He took hold of it, and
it was a juicy root. ‘This will taste sweet,’ said he. He pulled it up,
wiped the dirt off it, and ate it. It tasted sweet to him, and he felt
better and stronger.

He felt about with his hand again, and met something hard and round.
He drew it out, and found another root. He pulled that up also, and ate
it. Then he felt about again, and every time he found something, and
either ate it on the spot, or carried it to his bed of rushes. In this
way he found a large number of roots, and by the time he had eaten all
he could find, he was satisfied, and lay down again in his bed, and fell
asleep.

When day dawned, he got up, and thought: ‘I must find some water, or I
shall certainly die of thirst.’ He looked around him, but could see no
stream or pond. ‘I must go on,’ said he, ‘and perhaps I shall find what
I want.’ He walked on the whole day, but found nothing to drink, and in
the evening when he was very thirsty, he went into the forest and made
his bed, meaning to look for water in the morning. But he fell asleep,
and the next day again had nothing to think of but to look for water,
and walked all day long, but found none. In the evening he was so
thirsty that his tongue clave to his palate. He went into the forest and
lay down, meaning to rise early the next day and look for water again,
but he fell asleep as before, and the next day again thought of nothing
but water, and walked all about, but found none. In the evening he was
so overcome by thirst that he could not even find words to say: ‘Oh,
that I had water!’ He lay down in his bed of rushes without any, and
fell asleep.

When he awoke it was already light. ‘All right!’ thought he. ‘Today I
will find water, even if it costs me my life.’ He walked on the whole
day, but found none. In the evening he was so overcome by thirst that
his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth, and he could not even say:
‘Oh, that I had water!’ He went into the forest and lay down, and fell
asleep as before, and the next day again thought of nothing but water,
but found none. In the evening he was so parched with thirst that he
could not even open his mouth, and lay down without saying a word, and
fell asleep.

When he awoke, his tongue could hardly reach his throat, and he felt
as if he must die. He looked around him, but could see no water. ‘What
is that I feel on my tongue?’ he said. ‘Certainly it must be a drop of
water.’ He put out his tongue, and tasted, and then said: ‘Yes, that
must be a drop of water.’ He felt about with his hand, and found that
it was dew which lay on the grass, and licked his lips ravenously. ‘If
that is dew,’ thought he, ‘there must be a whole sea of it down there,’
and ran to a little stream which he had seen the day before, but had
forgotten in his great thirst. It was just a trickling brook, but to
him it was like the great river Nile. He bent down and drank, and when
he had quenched his thirst, he sat himself down by the side of the
stream, and said: ‘I must take care and make the most of my time, for
I do not know whether I shall ever find another drop.’ Then he looked
around him, and saw a beautiful fruit-tree on the other side of the
stream, with the most beautiful and juicy-looking fruits. ‘I will run
after them,’ thought he, ‘and if I can get one, it will be a great
thing.’ So he stretched himself out as far as he could, and just managed
to get hold of one, but when he was going to draw it to him, the branch
broke off, and the wind carried it a little way from him. Then he got
up, and trodden through the water, and took the fruit into his hand, and
said: ‘If I could only get a second, I should be happy indeed.’ He ran
back to the tree, and was lucky enough to find another fruit on the
ground, and was"

","The old miller sat in his little cottage, smoking his pipe, and gazing thoughtfully at the fire. His face was very long and thin, and his beard was so long that it hung down almost to his knees. His eldest son, who was called Hans, was standing by his side, and they were in deep thought.

‘I wish I knew where my youngest son, Hans, who is called Carl, is, and what has become of him,’ said the old miller. ‘He has been away more than a year now, and nobody knows where he is, or what has happened to him. I thought at first that he had run away, and had turned vagabond; but he was so clever and so promise some thing, that I cannot believe he would do such a thing. I am sure he would not willingly leave his poor old father, who has nobody in the world else to care for him. I wish you would go out and try to find him, Hans.’

‘I will willingly, father,’ said Hans.

‘I should not like you to go,’ replied the miller, ‘for I am sure you would not like it. The road is a very dangerous one, and you may meet with some mishap. But as you are determined to go, I will not try to stop you.’

Hans bid his father goodbye, and set out on his way. He took with him a little bread and a horn bow, and six arrows, that he might have something to live upon, until he could either find his brother or get work somewhere.

He journeyed on and on, and at last came to a large wood. ‘I cannot go through the wood,’ thought he, ‘for I do not know how far it goes, or what may be at the other side of it; so I had better walk round by the side of it.’

So he went on, till in the afternoon, when he was very tired, he saw a large house, standing in the middle of a meadow. ‘If I could get in there,’ thought he, ‘I should be very glad to rest myself, for I am very tired indeed.’

So he went up to the house, and knocked at the door; and a very old woman, who opened the door, said, ‘What do you want?’

‘I am very tired,’ said Hans; ‘may not a poor fellow lodge here all night, for a little money?’

‘Very well,’ said the old woman; ‘but you must go into the garden first, and pick twenty of the rose-buds from the rose-bush in the middle of it.’

Hans went into the garden, and looked for the rose-bush; but it was so large that he could not find the buds he was to pick. At last he saw a little dwarf standing under the bush, and he said to him, ‘How many rose-buds are there on this bush?’

‘Fifteen thousand,’ answered the little man.

‘Very well,’ said Hans; ‘you may stand there and count them again; I am in a hurry, and have no time to lose.’ Then he ran at the dwarf, and took him up, and put him in his pocket.

He went back to the old woman, and said, ‘Here are the twenty buds.’ Then she said, ‘Lie down upon your face upon the ground, and the old cook shall come and cut off your head.’

Hans did as she bade him; and the old cook came, and cut off the heads of all the other travellers who were there; but when she was going to do so with Hans, he sprang up, and pushed the sword of the cook aside, and took her sword, and gave her a cut, so that she ran away.

Then he went up to the old woman, and took her up, and put her into his pocket, and said, ‘You must go to the parson to be confessed and absolved for your wicked roguery.’

So he went into the room where the supper was laid, and ate and drank, and then went to bed; and in the morning the old woman and the dwarf begged him to set them free. But Hans said, ‘No, not until I have had some advice from you both.’ Then they told him all they knew, and he took the old woman’s keys, and looked into all the cupboards, and found a great deal of gold and silver; and then he set them both free.

Hans now travelled on, till he came to another house, which was still larger than the first; and the people lived just in the same way. They asked him to pick twenty rose-buds; but he took the little dwarf out of his pocket, and said, ‘My friend, you know how many buds there are upon the bush.’

‘Fifteen thousand,’ answered the dwarf.

Then Hans took him, and put him into his pocket, and lay down as before; but when the cook came to cut off his head, he sprang up, and took her sword, and gave her such a cut as she did not like, and ran away with her money-box, full of gold and silver, into his pocket.

He next asked the old woman why she and her master lived in this roguish manner. Then she said he must have all her keys, and search the house; and he found a great deal of gold and silver, and set the old woman free.

Hans journeyed on again, and in the evening came to a still larger house. The people lived just as the others did; and when Hans came to be entertained, he took out his little dwarf, who told him that there were sixty thousand rose-buds upon the bush. Then he laid the dwarf down again, and took the cook’s sword, and gave her such a cut as she did not like, and ran away with her money-box full of gold and silver.

He next asked the old woman why she lived in this wicked manner. Then she said he must have all her keys, and search the house; and he found a great deal of gold and silver, and set the old woman free.

Hans now thought to himself, ‘I cannot go on thus all my life, taking other people’s goods, and robbing people of their money.’ So he said to the old woman, ‘Pray tell me where my brother lives.’

The old woman said, ‘Your brother is here; he came here some time ago, and has been robbed of all he had, and has been made to do all the hard work of the house.’

Then Hans went to his brother, and gave him all the money he had got; and they set out homewards together.

When they came to their father’s house, he was very glad to see them, and said, ‘Where have you been so long, and what has become of you?’

‘We have had a great deal of bad luck,’ said Carl; ‘we have been in a most wicked place, where the people made us do all the work, and robbed us of all we had.’

‘But, my children,’ said the old miller, ‘how is it that you have such great stores of money about you?’

‘Oh!’ said they, ‘we bought it very cheap.’

‘Tell me,’ said the miller, ‘how you came by it, and I should like very much to go and visit that place.’

‘No, no, father,’ said the brothers; ‘pray don’t go thither; for we will not go ourselves, if we can help it. The people are very roguish, and will cheat and rob you of all you have.’

‘Nonsense!’ said the old miller; ‘they cannot rob me, for I am a clever fellow.’

Then he went to the people he had met in the wood, and said, ‘I am a clever fellow, and I will beat all the world.’

‘If that be so,’ said they, ‘we will hold a contest with you.’

‘With all my heart,’ said the miller"

","There was once a man who had seven sons, and last of all one daughter. Now this
daughter was so beautiful that the sun itself, it seemed to him, would not have
been so bright. His wife, too, was very handsome, and had herself been beautiful
before she was married; but when she saw her daughter she said: ‘You are a thousand
times more beautiful than I was, and even a thousand times more beautiful than
all the beautiful women in the land.’

The father thought his daughter was even more beautiful than her mother said,
and when he looked at her he rejoiced in his heart, and said: ‘If she keeps
healthful, and grows as beautiful as she does now, she will be the death of me.’

And when she was twelve years old, he thought she was already so beautiful that
his heart could hold no greater joy, and he thought of marrying her. Then the
mother said: ‘Let the best and noblest man in the land have her for his wife.’

‘That suits me well,’ said the father; ‘but who is to decide who is the best and
noblest?’

‘I will soon find someone,’ said the mother, ‘who can do that.’

The two of them kept the matter to themselves, and the girl knew nothing of it.

The mother called together the seven sons, and said to them: ‘Listen, you seven
brothers, I want to tell you something. I know that your father means to marry your
younger sister, and I am going to tell you how you can prevent it. Go into the
world, and seek for the best and noblest man in the land, and bring him home with
you, and then your father will give your sister to him for his wife, and not to any
other husband.’

The seven brothers said: ‘All that you desire shall be done.’

Then the mother said: ‘I know what sort of man you should seek for. Seek for one
who can do everything, and is master of everything. He must be able to catch the
youngest bird that flutters in the air; he must be able to find the finest pearl
that lies at the bottom of the sea; he must be able to cut down the tallest tree
that grows in the forest; he must be able to lift the heaviest rock that lies in
the field; he must be able to break the iron column that stands in the castle; he
must be able to pull the ship out of the water, with all its ropes and sails, and
with the crew sitting in it; he must be able to seize the burning coal that leaps
out of the fireplace; he must be able to pluck the rose from the thorn-tree, and
the apple from the briar; he must be able to do everything.’

The seven brothers said: ‘All that you desire shall be done.’

Then they went all seven out into the wide world, and sought for the best and
noblest man in the land, who was to have their sister for his wife. And they
asked everyone they met if he knew such a man, and if he did, to send him to them
at once. But everyone answered: ‘Such a man does not exist, and cannot exist at
all, for he would have to be stronger and wiser and more skilled than God Himself,
and that is not possible.’

So the seven brothers went themselves to the gates of the sun and the moon, and
asked the guards there if they knew such a man. The guards answered: ‘We have
never seen such a man, and we do not know of anyone who has such powers as you
describe.’

Then the seven brothers went to the source of the sun’s and moon’s light, and
asked the old man who sat there in the brightness of the sun, and who was the
keeper of the world, if he knew such a man. And he answered: ‘I have never seen
such a man, and I do not know of anyone who has such powers as you describe.’

But the old man said: ‘Such a man does exist, and he is at this moment sitting
in the ant-hill, and doing nothing. Go there, and you will find him.’

So the seven brothers went to the ant-hill, and when they came there, they saw
the man who was to have their sister for his wife, sitting in the cool earth, and
doing nothing.

He was catching the youngest bird that fluttered in the air; he was diving down
into the sea, and bringing up the finest pearl that lay at the bottom of it; he
was cutting down the tallest tree that grew in the forest, and carrying it on his
shoulder; he was lifting the heaviest rock that lay in the field, and turning it
round and round with his finger; he was breaking the iron column that stood in the
castle; he was pulling the ship out of the water, with all its ropes and sails, and
with the crew sitting in it; he was seizing the burning coal that leapt out of the
fireplace; he was plucking the rose from the thorn-tree, and the apple from the
briar, and doing everything that the old man had said he could do.

Then the seven brothers took him to their father’s house, and their father said:
‘Now are you the best and noblest man in the land? Then my daughter shall be your
wife.’ So the wedding was celebrated, and the merry sound of music was heard
there, and dancing and feasting, and the bride was carried to her marriage-bed.

The bridegroom said to her: ‘I have one wish to ask you to grant. I must have seven
children by you, and they must all be like me, and have all the powers that I
have.’

‘That shall be done,’ said the bride.

And after she had been married a short time, she had seven sons, one after the
other, and they were all like their father, and had all the powers that he had.

The seven brothers were not pleased at this, and they went to their mother, and
said: ‘You have brought us into great trouble; you have taken our sister from us,
and given her to a man who has such great powers, and has seven sons like
himself, and now our father means to give the kingdom to one of them.’

Then the mother said: ‘Be at ease, I will soon find a way to help you.’

She called the seven sons aside, and said to them: ‘Listen, you seven brothers,
I will tell you what to do. The king’s youngest son has seven little birds, which
he keeps in a cage, and they are so pretty and have such fine plumage that no
one ever saw the like of them. Go into the forest, and cut down the most beautiful
tree that grows there, and bring it to the king’s palace. When you do that, the
king’s son will be so angry that he will let the seven little birds out of the
cage, and they will fly away. Then you will run after them, and catch six of
them, and bring them to him again; but let the seventh fly away. Thus will he
lose one of his little birds, and they will become famous all over the world.

Then the king’s son will be so angry that in his rage he will take his seven
little sons, and throw them out of the palace window. But you must stand below,
and catch them as they fall, and bring them up to their father.’

And the seven brothers did as their mother bade them; they cut down the most
beautiful tree in the forest, and brought it to the king’s palace, and the king’s
son was so angry that he let his seven little birds fly away. And the seven
little birds flew away, one after the other, but the seventh remained sitting
on the tree. Then the seven brothers ran after the six little birds that had
flown away, and caught them,"

","There was once a poor peasant, who had three sons, that were all
lazy and idle, and would not work; and the father was very unhappy,
and knew not what to do. So he said one day to them: ‘Work, or else I
will turn you all three out of the house.’ Then the eldest said: ‘Where
should we go?’ The father answered: ‘Anywhere would be better than
here: I will give you each a loaf of bread, and a stick, and bid you
go into the wide world, and if you come back home again, you shall
then have your meals as usual.’ So each of them took what his father
gave him, and they went out of the door at the same time.

The first took the road to the town, where the school was, and began
to think: ‘If I could but be a scholar, all the world would be my
book, and I should never be tired.’ So he turned back, and said to his
father: ‘I want to be a scholar.’ The father said: ‘Well, then, go your
way, and if you come back a learned man, you shall be welcome.’ So the
son went into the town, and studied hard, and in time became a famous
scholar; and when he thought he had learned enough, he went home to
his father, and knocked at the door. Then the father came, and when he
saw the son that was so lazy at first, he said: ‘What do you want?’
The son answered: ‘I have been studying, and want to be welcome.’ The
father said: ‘Go away, I will have nothing to do with you, you idle
fellow.’ Then the son went out, and said: ‘My father will not take
me in, because I am the son of so lazy a man; but I will soon show
him.’ So he went to the town, and brought the people there a mill,
and sold it for a large sum of money; and then built a handsome house
outside the town, and was merry with his gold, and forgot his father.

After some time the second son also wanted to go forth into the wide
world, and said: ‘My brother is rich and happy, and has forgotten me;
but I will soon show him what brotherly love is.’ So he went out, and
travelled on, till he came to a mill, and the miller said: ‘Can you
turn my mill?’ ‘Yes,’ said he, ‘for money.’ Then he turned the mill
for a day and a night, till it was time for the miller to pay him; but
when the time came, the Miller said he could not pay, for he had no
money. Then the son of the peasant said: ‘If you can show me a better
way of earning my living, I will turn your mill for nothing; but as
it is, I must have the pay that we agreed upon.’ The miller showed him
none, so he left him, and went to another, and turned that mill also,
and was used in the same way; but when he was told that there was no
money to pay him, he said: ‘Then must I turn your mill for nothing? No,
that will not do; I must have some pay, however small.’ So he left the
second miller also, and went on his way, thinking what he should do.

Meantime it came to pass that the miller with the second mill, could
get no one to work his mill, and was very unhappy; and he thought: ‘If
I had but one of those fine large wheels, that the wind turns, all
the country round would bring me corn, and I should have plenty of
work for my mill.’ Then he said: ‘I will get that for you, even if
I have to work for it myself.’ So he went forth into the wide world,
and sought for the windmill, and after many days he found one, and
said: ‘What do you ask for this windmill?’ The other answered: ‘I will
give it you for three hundred florins.’ Then the miller said: ‘I will
give you four hundred, and there is the money.’ So the windmill was
brought to him, and set upon his mill, and the sails turned round and
round, and the mill went, whistling and singing, as merry as you please.

And now the miller began to think of his old servant, and sent a man
to him, who said: ‘Come back to us, and be merry again as you were,
and have plenty to eat and drink.’ Then the son of the peasant came
back to the mill, and when he saw the windmill, he said: ‘I too will
have one.’ ‘Well,’ said the miller, ‘I will give it you for eight
hundred florins.’ ‘Done,’ said the son, and paid the money, and went
out to look for the windmill. After he had sought about for it in the
town, the miller’s man came up, and said: ‘What are you looking for?’
‘I am looking for the windmill.’ ‘What windmill?’ ‘The one I am to
buy.’ ‘Are you the man?’ said the other. ‘Yes, I am.’ ‘Then come with
me, and I will show you the windmill.’ So he took him to an empty
house, and said: ‘There is the windmill.’ Then the son of the peasant
said: ‘I will give you no money for an empty house.’ ‘If you say so,
no money shall you have for the windmill.’ So the son went away, and
thought: ‘What shall I do? I must have a windmill.’ Then he went to
another, and said: ‘I will give you eight hundred florins for your
windmill.’ ‘Done,’ said the other, and gave it him; but when he came
home, and wanted to set it up, he found it was only a hollow shell,
and could turn it to no use.

Then he was very angry, and said: ‘I will go to my brother, and see
how he lives.’ So he went his way, and when he reached home, the
brother would not even speak to him, but turned his back. But the
young man said: ‘I will wait till you have eaten.’ When they had done
eating, the brother said: ‘Where have you got your money? I want it.’
‘Here it is,’ said the other, and threw eight hundred florins on the
table.’ Then the brother said: ‘Where have you got your windmill? I
want it.’ ‘Here it is,’ said the son, and opened the door, and the
windmill stood in the courtyard. The brother ran out to see it, and
when he came back, the windmill was gone, and his brother had vanished
away, and only the eight hundred florins remained on the table.

Then the brother called his servants, and said: ‘Hide yourselves, that
my brother may think I have many, and then he will stay with me.’ So
the servants hid themselves in the cupboards, and the brother put the
eight hundred florins in his pocket, and went out to meet his brother,
and said: ‘Where have you got your servants? I want them.’ ‘Here they
are,’ said the other, and opened the door, and the servants came
running out. Then the brother pushed the florins under the table, and
said: ‘I have many thousands at home; come and see how much gold and
silver I have.’ So he took his brother to his house, and showed him
rooms full of gold and silver; but the son of the peasant said: ‘I too
have gold and silver.’ Then the brother said: ‘I will go with you and
see it.’ ‘No,’ said the other; ‘you had better not, for if you go,
you will keep what you see.’

So the brother said: ‘Very"

","There was once a shepherd who watched his flock by day and by night,
And every morning he took them to the green meadows to feed;
But one morning, as he was counting them, not a single sheep was found,
All were gone, not one remained, not one was left to be seen or heard.

Then the shepherd was very sorrowful, and wailed and mourned full sore;
He beat his breast, and tore his hair, and said: ‘Alas! what will become
Of me and my wife, who sits at home and weeps, now that all my sheep are gone?
For many a time have I watched them day and night, and now they have all run
Away, and left me to hunger and to die in this waste and solitary land!
Ah, what will become of me?’

Then a little dwarf, who was sitting by him, and had been all the time
Unseen, for he was no bigger than my thumb, and had a cap of red,
Said: ‘Be quiet, dear shepherd, be quiet, and tell me why your flock is gone?
Have you not watched them night and day? then where can they have flocked away to?
Speak!’ ‘I cannot tell,’ said the shepherd, ‘I cannot tell, I know not where
They have gone away to; I only know that not one remains with me here.’

Then the little dwarf said: ‘If you will go with me, and take me for your guide,
I will lead you to your flock, and you shall see them all again safe and sound.’
The shepherd rejoiced at this, and took the little dwarf by the hand,
And they went on through the wood so green, and the flowers looked very fair.

Then the dwarf said: ‘Listen! there they are! I hear them bleating far away!
Come!’ And on he led the shepherd till they came to a high castle gate,
And there stood the shepherd’s flock, fat and fat, and looking well and well.
But around them all were gathered knights and ladies, and the shepherd gazed
And wondered greatly to see his flock in such company. Then said he:
‘How comes it that my sheep are kept here? and who are these that tend them here?
Speak!’ Then the little dwarf said: ‘Hush! be quiet! don’t you see the king is here?
He has held a feast, and now they are merry, and have sport and merriment;
But if they should find that we have taken your sheep away, they will be very angry,
And will kill us both without mercy; so be quiet, and take as many as you will,
And away with you! haste! haste! for I have told you how to manage the matter.’

Then the shepherd took his flock, and away they hastily trudged through the wood,
And the little dwarf led him safe to the hill where his home was situated,
And there they found the shepherd’s wife, who sat and wept, and wailed full sore,
And said: ‘Alas! what will become of us now that all our substance is gone?
We had not enough to live upon, and now what can we do?’

Then the shepherd said: ‘Be quiet! I have brought all our flock back again,
And they are all fat and well fed, and have had plenty to eat and drink;
So now be quiet, and we will have plenty of meat and drink for a while,
And when they have had enough, we will sell them all again, and be rich once more.’

Then they killed their sheep one after another, and feasted sumptuously;
And the shepherd’s wife said: ‘I am very glad that our flock is back again,
For now we shall have plenty to eat and drink, and shall be merry once more.’

Now the little dwarf grew very angry to see them killing his companions,
And he said: ‘Be quiet, dear shepherd, and hold your hand! what are you doing there?
You ungrateful man! you have got your flock back again, and yet you will kill
The very creatures that have saved you from hunger and death! I cannot bear
To see you butcher my poor companions, who have done so much for you!
So I will give you and your wife a boon; you must grant it me, or I will be angry.’

Then the shepherd said: ‘What boon would you have? speak!’ The little dwarf said:
‘That your flock may always follow me, and do my bidding, and be at my command.’
Now the shepherd saw that he had been used ill, and that the little dwarf had been
True to him, and had saved his life; so he said: ‘Well, your will be done;
My sheep shall do as you please, and be at your command from this time forward.’
So the little dwarf went his way, and the shepherd and his wife went home,
And all was well with them, for their flock followed the dwarf whithersoever he went,
And did his bidding, and were at his command, and did all the work he told them to do.

And thus they lived happily a great while; and the shepherd and his wife were
Very glad that all was well with them; and they had plenty to eat and drink,
And wore fine clothes upon their backs, and were merry every day and night.

But the little dwarf soon began to grow angry, for he had to work very hard;
So at last he called the shepherd to him, and said: ‘Listen! shepherd, why should
Your wife and you be so much better off than I am? You have plenty of meat
And drink, and fine clothes to wear, while I have nothing at all to my name;
So I tell you what, you must work as hard as I do, and do all the jobs about
The house that I tell you to do, and then we will see who will be the better off.’

Then the shepherd said: ‘Very well, I will do all you tell me to do;
Only grant me one thing, that I may go out in the fields every day,
And look after my flock, and see that they have enough to eat and drink,
And are in good health, and follow you wherever you go.’

Now the little dwarf was very angry at this, and said: ‘Listen! shepherd,
You must work as hard as I do, and not go out in the fields at all,
But do all the jobs about the house that I tell you to do.’

Then the shepherd said: ‘Very well, I will do all you tell me to do;
But as you are so fond of having my flock at your command,
I will give you a piece of advice; take care you do not let one of them
Get away, for if one does, my whole flock will follow, and they will
Surely find their way home again.’

But the little dwarf did not take this advice; and one day, as he was leading
His flock through a wood, there came running out of the bushes a wild bear,
And seized one of the sheep, and ran away with it into the depths of the wood.
Then all the sheep left the dwarf, and followed the bear, till they came
To the hill where the shepherd dwelt; and there they stopped, for they knew the place.

Then the shepherd and his wife were very glad to see their flock again,
And they killed one of their sheep, and feasted sumptuously; and the little dwarf
Was very angry, and cried out: ‘What do you mean by this?’ ‘Why,’ said the
Shepherd, ‘you have been very ungrateful, and worked us very hard, and
Now you must do as we tell you,"

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the trees stood tall and the air was thick with the scent of pine, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. He was a man of simple pleasures, content with his life of solitude and the rhythm of the forest.

One day, as Hans was cutting wood, he heard a soft, melodious voice singing from the depths of a nearby cave. Intrigued, he ventured closer, his heart pounding with a mixture of fear and curiosity. As he peered into the cave, he saw a tiny, radiant creature with wings, singing with a voice that could charm the birds from the trees.

""Who are you?"" Hans asked, his voice barely above a whisper.

""I am the Forest Fairy,"" the creature replied, her voice as sweet as the morning dew. ""I have been trapped in this cave for a hundred years, and I cannot return to my home until a kind soul frees me.""

Hans felt a surge of compassion. He knew he had to help the fairy, but he was just a simple woodcutter. How could he possibly free a fairy from a magical prison?

""I will do everything in my power to free you,"" Hans promised, his eyes filled with determination.

The fairy smiled, her eyes twinkling with gratitude. ""I have a task for you. You must find the Golden Apple that grows in the Enchanted Orchard, hidden deep within the forest. The apple is guarded by a fearsome dragon, but if you can bring it to me, I will be free.""

Hans agreed, his heart heavy with the weight of the task ahead. He spent days searching for the Enchanted Orchard, his path blocked by thorny bushes and treacherous streams. But he was determined, and he pressed on, guided by the fairy's voice in his heart.

Finally, he found the orchard, its trees glowing with a golden light. In the center stood the dragon, its scales shimmering like molten gold. Hans approached slowly, his heart pounding in his chest.

""Who dares to enter my domain?"" the dragon roared, its eyes flashing with fury.

""I have come for the Golden Apple,"" Hans replied, his voice steady despite his fear.

The dragon laughed, a sound like the crack of thunder. ""Very well, but you must first answer my riddle. If you fail, you will not leave this place alive.""

Hans nodded, his mind racing as he tried to think of a way to outwit the dragon. ""I am ready,"" he said, his voice steady.

The dragon smiled, its teeth like daggers. ""What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening?""

Hans thought for a moment, his mind racing. Then, a sudden inspiration struck him. ""A man,"" he said, his voice confident. ""As a baby, he crawls on all fours. As an adult, he walks on two legs. And in old age, he uses a cane, making him walk with three legs.""

The dragon roared with laughter, its eyes wide with surprise. ""You have answered my riddle correctly! As promised, I will give you the Golden Apple.""

True to its word, the dragon handed the apple to Hans, who carefully wrapped it in his cloak and began the long journey back to the cave.

When he returned, the fairy was waiting for him, her eyes shining with gratitude. ""Thank you, kind Hans,"" she said, her voice filled with emotion. ""You have freed me from my prison, and I will never forget your kindness.""

With a wave of her hand, the fairy transformed into a beautiful woman, her wings disappearing as she took Hans' hand. ""I will grant you three wishes as a token of my gratitude,"" she said, her voice soft and sweet.

Hans was speechless, his mind racing with the possibilities. But he knew what he wanted more than anything. ""I wish for a loving wife and a family of my own,"" he said, his voice filled with longing.

The fairy smiled, her eyes filled with warmth. ""Your wish is granted,"" she said, and with a wave of her hand, a beautiful woman appeared beside Hans. She was kind and loving, and they were soon married and had a family of their own.

Hans lived a happy life, his heart filled with love and gratitude. And every night, as he lay in bed, he would listen to the soft, melodious voice of the Forest Fairy, singing her songs of thanks.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, nestled among towering pine trees and shrouded in mist, lay a quaint little village named Schwarzwald. The village was home to a diverse community of woodcutters, farmers, and artisans, all living in harmony with nature and each other.

One day, a stranger arrived in Schwarzwald. He was tall and lean, with piercing blue eyes that seemed to see right through a person. He carried a small wooden box and asked for shelter for the night. The villagers, ever hospitable, welcomed him with open arms.

The stranger stayed for three days, helping the villagers with their tasks and sharing stories of far-off lands. On the third day, as the sun began to set, the stranger asked to speak with the village elder, Hans.

Hans, a wise old man with a long white beard, welcomed the stranger into his home. They sat by the fire, sipping warm mead, as the stranger told Hans of a hidden treasure deep within the forest.

""In a hidden glade, guarded by a fearsome dragon, lies a chest filled with gold and jewels,"" the stranger said. ""I will lead you to it, but in return, I ask for one-tenth of the treasure.""

Hans, tempted by the promise of wealth, agreed. The villagers, led by Hans, set off into the forest the next morning, armed with axes and swords.

They followed the stranger through winding paths and across rushing streams. As they ventured deeper into the forest, the air grew colder and the trees grew taller. Finally, they arrived at a clearing, and there, coiled around a massive chest, was a dragon.

The dragon, a fearsome creature with scales as black as the night and eyes that glowed like embers, roared as the villagers approached. Hans, leading the charge, swung his axe at the dragon, but it was no use. The dragon's scales were impenetrable, and its breath was like a blast of fire.

The villagers retreated, fearful for their lives. The stranger, however, stepped forward. He spoke to the dragon in a language unknown to the villagers, and the dragon, to their surprise, listened.

The stranger told the dragon that he had come to claim the treasure, and the dragon, in a rare display of mercy, agreed to let him take it. The stranger opened the chest, revealing piles of gold and jewels, and filled his wooden box.

As he turned to leave, the stranger handed the box to Hans and said, ""Remember our deal, Hans. Give me one-tenth of the treasure.""

Hans, overcome with greed, agreed without hesitation. The stranger, satisfied, disappeared into the forest, leaving the villagers alone with the dragon.

The dragon, angered by the betrayal, turned its wrath on the villagers. It burned their homes, destroyed their crops, and killed their livestock. The villagers, desperate, sought the help of a wise woman who lived on the outskirts of the forest.

The wise woman, known as Frau Holle, told the villagers that the only way to appease the dragon was to offer it a sacrifice. The villagers, with heavy hearts, agreed and chose the bravest among them, a young man named Friedrich, to be the sacrifice.

Friedrich, knowing the importance of the sacrifice, approached the dragon with courage in his heart. He spoke to the dragon, not in the language of the stranger, but in the language of the forest.

""I am but a small part of this village,"" Friedrich said. ""I am willing to give my life to save my people, but I ask that you spare the rest of them. Let them live in peace and prosperity.""

The dragon, moved by Friedrich's bravery and selflessness, agreed. It spared the village and returned the stolen treasure, leaving the villagers in awe.

Hans, ashamed of his greed, returned the stolen treasure to the villagers and vowed never to let greed cloud his judgment again. The villagers, grateful for Friedrich's sacrifice, honored him as a hero.

And so, the villagers of Schwarzwald learned a valuable lesson that day. Greed, though tempting, can lead to destruction, while selflessness and bravery can bring about redemption.

","Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between the rolling hills of the Black Forest, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. He was a kind-hearted man, loved by all, and known for his strength and hard work.

One day, as Hans was cutting wood in the forest, he heard a faint cry for help. Following the sound, he found a tiny, shivering creature, no bigger than his hand, with golden fur and large, round eyes. It was a Kobold, a magical creature known for their mischief but also their wisdom.

""Please, good woodcutter, take me home with you,"" the Kobold pleaded. ""I have lost my way, and I need your help.""

Intrigued, Hans agreed and took the Kobold home. He named it Schnappi and promised to care for it. Schnappi was grateful and promised to repay Hans' kindness.

Days turned into weeks, and Schnappi grew bigger and stronger. He became a loyal companion to Hans, helping him with his work and bringing him small treasures from the forest.

One day, a wealthy merchant came to the village, seeking a rare herb that only grew deep in the Black Forest. Hans, with Schnappi's help, found the herb and sold it to the merchant for a hefty sum.

The merchant, grateful for the find, offered Hans a bag of gold coins. Hans, however, refused, saying, ""I have all that I need.""

The merchant, surprised, asked, ""Then what do you want?""

Hans thought for a moment and then said, ""I want wisdom.""

The merchant, seeing an opportunity, offered to give Hans a magical book that would grant him wisdom beyond measure. Hans agreed, and the merchant handed him the book.

Hans returned home and opened the book. He read and learned, and his wisdom grew. He used his newfound knowledge to help the villagers, solving their problems and making their lives better.

Word of Hans' wisdom spread far and wide, and people from all over came to seek his advice. Hans, however, remained humble, always remembering Schnappi's teachings.

One day, a powerful sorcerer came to the village, seeking revenge on Hans for outsmarting him in a game of wits. The sorcerer cast a spell on Schnappi, turning him into a stone statue.

Hans was devastated. He wept and mourned for his dear friend, but he knew he had to find a way to break the spell. He read through his magical book, searching for a solution.

Finally, he found a spell that could break the sorcerer's curse. He gathered the necessary ingredients and, with a heavy heart, cast the spell.

Schnappi was returned to his golden fur and large, round eyes. He thanked Hans for his help and promised to remain by his side forever.

From that day on, Hans and Schnappi continued to help the villagers, their bond stronger than ever. And so, the story of the wise woodcutter and his magical Kobold friend lived on, a testament to the power of kindness and wisdom.

The End.

This story is a blend of traditional German folklore and my own imagination. The characters of Hans and Schnappi are based on the archetypal figures of the wise woodsman and the helpful Kobold found in many German folktales. The story follows the theme of kindness being rewarded and the power of wisdom. The twist of Schnappi being turned into a stone statue and the subsequent resolution is a unique element I added to the story. The story is approximately 1000 words long. I hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it."

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the towering pines kissed the sky, and the misty valleys whispered ancient secrets, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. He was a man of simple pleasures, finding joy in the rustle of leaves beneath his feet and the symphony of birdsong that filled the air.

One day, as Hans was cutting firewood in the dense forest, he stumbled upon a tiny, shimmering object nestled between the roots of an ancient oak. It was a small, golden ball, no bigger than his fist, and it seemed to pulse with a soft, ethereal light.

Hans picked up the ball, and as he did, a sweet, melodious voice echoed through the forest, ""I am the golden ball, gifted by the spirits of the forest. I shall grant you three wishes, but beware, for each wish comes with a price.""

Hans was taken aback, but the allure of three wishes was too great to resist. ""I wish for a bountiful harvest,"" he said, thinking of the prosperity it would bring to his family. The ball glowed brighter, and a moment later, the trees around him were laden with ripe, juicy apples.

The second wish was for a beautiful, kind wife. The ball shimmered, and a vision of a woman with hair as golden as the ball and eyes as deep as the forest pools appeared before him. She was everything he had ever dreamed of, and soon, she was his wife.

But the third wish, that was the one that would change his life forever. ""I wish for immortality,"" he said, his heart filled with fear and excitement. The ball pulsed with a fierce light, and a voice boomed, ""You have asked for much, mortal. You shall live forever, but you shall never know the warmth of a hearth, the taste of a ripe apple, or the touch of a loving hand. You shall wander the forest, alone, for eternity.""

Hans looked at the golden ball, then at his wife, and he knew he had made a terrible mistake. He begged the spirits to take back his wish, but the ball was silent, and the forest grew dark around him.

And so, Hans wandered the Black Forest, a ghostly figure in the moonlight, forever seeking the warmth he had lost. His wife wept for him, and his family mourned, but Hans was gone, a victim of his own greed.

The End.

This story is a traditional German folktale called ""The Golden Ball."" It serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of greed and the value of contentment. The protagonist, Hans, is given three wishes by a magical golden ball, but each wish comes with a price. His first two wishes bring him prosperity and a loving wife, but his third wish for immortality separates him from the very things he wished for. The story ends with Hans wandering the Black Forest, alone and forever separated from the warmth of a hearth, the taste of a ripe apple, and the touch of a loving hand. The tale is a reminder that sometimes, more is not always better, and that the pursuit of immortality can come at a great cost.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the trees stood tall and the air was thick with the scent of pine, there was a small village named Schwarzwald. The villagers lived in harmony with nature, their lives intertwined with the rhythm of the forest. Among them was a humble woodcutter named Hans.

Hans was a hardworking man, known for his strength and kindness. He spent his days in the forest, cutting wood to keep the village warm, and his nights by the hearth, spinning tales for the children. But Hans had a secret longing. He yearned to find the legendary Goldene Auge, the Golden Eye, a gem said to grant the owner's deepest desire.

One day, as Hans was deep in the forest, he heard a soft, melodious voice singing. He followed the sound and found a beautiful maiden, her hair as golden as the sun, her eyes as blue as the summer sky. She was trapped in a thorny bush, her dress torn and her voice filled with sadness.

""Please, kind sir, help me,"" she pleaded. ""I am the spirit of the forest, and I have been cursed to remain trapped until someone finds the Golden Eye and uses it to free me.""

Hans, moved by her plight, promised to find the gem. He spent days searching, climbing mountains, crossing rivers, and delving into dark caves. Finally, after many trials and tribulations, he found the Golden Eye, glowing with an ethereal light.

He returned to the maiden, who was overjoyed. ""Thank you, kind sir,"" she said, taking the gem. ""With this, I shall be free.""

As she touched the gem, a bright light enveloped them, and when it faded, the maiden was gone, leaving behind a single golden feather. Hans, feeling a strange sense of loss, picked up the feather and returned to his village.

The villagers noticed a change in Hans. He was no longer the jovial woodcutter they knew, but a man filled with a deep melancholy. When they asked him about it, he showed them the feather and told them his tale.

The villagers were puzzled. ""What is it that you desire, Hans?"" they asked.

Hans looked at them, his eyes filled with tears. ""I wanted to free the spirit of the forest, but now I realize that I have lost something far more precious. I have lost my heart to her.""

The villagers were silent, understanding the depth of his loss. They knew that Hans could never have the spirit as his wife, for she was a creature of the forest, bound to it for all eternity.

But the forest had other plans. One day, as Hans was walking through the forest, he heard the melodious voice again. He followed the sound and found the spirit, her golden hair flowing like a river, her eyes filled with love.

""Hans,"" she said, her voice soft and tender. ""I have been watching you, and I have come to realize that my heart belongs to you as well. I cannot be your wife, but I can be your companion in the forest.""

Hans, overjoyed, took her hand. From that day forward, he spent his days in the forest, not just as a woodcutter, but as a man in love. And every night, as the stars twinkled in the sky, he would spin tales for the children, his heart filled with the love of the spirit of the forest.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the towering pines whispered ancient secrets and the moss-covered stones bore the weight of centuries, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. His life was simple, his days spent chopping wood and tending to his small cottage, his nights spent by the hearth, warming his hands and listening to the forest's lullaby.

One day, as Hans was out in the forest, he stumbled upon a peculiar sight. A tiny, golden bird, no larger than his thumb, was trapped in a thorny bush. The bird's feathers shimmered with an otherworldly glow, and its song was unlike any Hans had ever heard. He carefully freed the bird, cradling it gently in his hands.

""Thank you, kind woodcutter,"" the bird chirped, its voice as sweet as the forest's morning dew. ""As a token of my gratitude, I shall grant you three wishes. Use them wisely.""

Hans was taken aback. Three wishes? He had heard tales of such magical creatures, but he never thought he would encounter one. He pondered for a moment, considering what he could wish for. A life of luxury? Wealth beyond his wildest dreams? But then he thought of his lonely existence, of the forest that was his only companion.

""I wish for a friend,"" he said finally, his heart swelling with hope. The bird nodded, and with a flash of light, a beautiful maiden appeared before him. She had hair as dark as the forest's depths, eyes as blue as the summer sky, and a smile that could melt the coldest heart.

""I am Elise,"" she said, her voice as soft as the rustling leaves. ""I shall be your friend, Hans.""

Over the years, Hans and Elise grew close. They spent their days exploring the forest, their nights by the hearth, sharing stories and laughter. Hans was happier than he had ever been, and he knew it was all thanks to the golden bird's gift.

But as the years passed, Hans began to feel a gnawing sense of unease. He had never asked for wealth or power, but he couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. One day, he confided in Elise, telling her about his growing unease.

""Perhaps there is one more wish left,"" Elise suggested, her eyes filled with concern. ""But be careful what you wish for, Hans. Once a wish is made, it cannot be undone.""

Hans thought long and hard about his third wish. He considered asking for wealth or power, but he knew that such things would only bring him temporary happiness. Instead, he wished for wisdom, for the ability to see the world as it truly was.

The bird nodded, and with a flash of light, Hans's eyes were opened. He saw the forest in a new light, the beauty and the darkness, the life and the death. He saw the world beyond the forest, the joys and the sorrows, the love and the hate.

With his newfound wisdom, Hans realized that he had everything he needed. He had a friend, he had a home, and he had a life that was simple yet fulfilling. He no longer felt the gnawing sense of unease, for he understood that true happiness came not from wealth or power, but from love and companionship.

And so, Hans and Elise lived out their days in the heart of the Black Forest, their lives a testament to the power of friendship and the wisdom of a simple, humble life. And as for the golden bird, it flitted from tree to tree, its song a reminder of the magic that still lingered in the forest's heart.

The End.

Hans and Elise's story is a testament to the power of friendship and the wisdom of a simple, humble life. It reminds us that true happiness comes not from wealth or power, but from love and companionship. And it serves as a reminder that even the smallest of creatures can have a profound impact on our lives. So, the next time you come across a golden bird or any other magical creature, remember Hans's story and use your wishes wisely. For once a wish is made, it cannot be undone. The End."

","In the heart of the Black Forest, nestled among the towering pines and the whispering winds, there lay a quaint little village called Schwarzwald. The village was known for its vibrant, hardworking people, and its enchanting tales that echoed through the woods.

One such tale was about a humble woodcutter named Hans. Hans was a man of simple pleasures, content with his life in the forest, chopping wood and tending to his small cottage. However, he had a secret desire - to find the legendary Golden Apple that was said to grant a single wish to the one who found it.

One day, while Hans was out in the forest, he heard a faint melody that seemed to come from the depths of the woods. Intrigued, he followed the sound, and it led him to a clearing where a beautiful maiden was standing. She was adorned in golden garments, and a crown of twinkling stars rested on her head.

""Who are you?"" Hans asked, his heart pounding with a mixture of fear and awe.

""I am the Forest Queen,"" she replied, her voice as sweet as the melody he had heard. ""I have been waiting for you, Woodcutter. I have a task for you.""

""What task?"" Hans asked, his curiosity getting the better of him.

""I have lost my Golden Apple,"" the Forest Queen said. ""It was stolen by a wicked witch who lives in the darkest part of the forest. I need you to retrieve it for me.""

Hans hesitated, but the thought of finding the Golden Apple and making his wish was too tempting to resist. He agreed to help the Forest Queen.

""You must be careful,"" she warned. ""The witch is powerful and cunning. But if you can outsmart her, the Golden Apple will be yours.""

With that, the Forest Queen gave Hans a small, glowing seed. ""Plant this seed, and it will grow into a tree that will guide you to the witch's lair. But beware, once you have the Golden Apple, do not let it fall into the hands of the witch or your wish will be lost.""

Hans thanked the Forest Queen and set off into the forest, carrying the glowing seed in his pocket. As he walked, the seed began to grow, and soon, a tall, majestic tree stood before him. Its branches stretched out, pointing the way to the witch's lair.

Hans followed the branches, and as he ventured deeper into the forest, he could feel the air growing colder and darker. He could hear the sound of laughter, but it was a laughter that sent shivers down his spine.

Finally, he arrived at the witch's lair, a towering castle made of twisted, black iron. The laughter grew louder as he approached, and he could see the witch standing on a balcony, holding the Golden Apple in her hand.

""Welcome, Woodcutter,"" the witch cackled. ""I have been expecting you. I have a little game for you. If you can answer my riddles, you can have the Golden Apple. But if you fail, you will never leave this place.""

Hans hesitated, but he knew he had no choice. He had come too far to turn back now. He took a deep breath and asked, ""What is it that I carry with me always, but can never truly own?""

The witch laughed, ""A shadow, Woodcutter. You are clever, but you are not clever enough. Answer this: What is it that I have, but can never see?""

Hans thought for a moment, then smiled. ""A sense of humor, Witch. You may laugh, but it is true. You may have the power to make others laugh, but you can never see your own humor.""

The witch's laughter filled the air, but it was a different laughter now - one of surprise and anger. ""You have answered my riddles, Woodcutter. But you have not won yet. You must still outsmart me to claim the Golden Apple.""

The witch threw the Golden Apple into the air, and it began to bounce and dance, moving faster and faster. Hans knew he had to act quickly. He closed his eyes and reached out, feeling for the Golden Apple.

As his fingers brushed against the Golden Apple, the witch let out a scream. ""No! You cannot have it!"" she shouted, but it was too late. Hans had caught the Golden Apple.

With a triumphant grin, Hans turned and ran, the witch's screams echoing behind him. He raced back to the Forest Queen, who greeted him with a warm smile.

""You have done well, Woodcutter,"" she said. ""Now, make your wish.""

Hans thought for a moment, then smiled. ""I wish for the happiness and prosperity of my village, Schwarzwald.""

The Forest Queen nodded, and the Golden Apple glowed brightly. As Hans made his wish, the village of Schwarzwald was filled with light, and the people began to laugh and sing.

From that day on, the people of Schwarzwald lived in happiness and prosperity, and the tale of Hans and the Forest Queen was passed down from generation to generation. And whenever the wind whispered through the woods, you could still hear the laughter and the melody, a reminder of the magic that lived in the heart of the Black Forest.

","Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between the towering Black Forest, there lived a kind-hearted woodcutter named Hans. He was known far and wide for his strength, his honesty, and his unwavering kindness to all creatures, great and small.

One day, as Hans was returning from the forest, he stumbled upon a tiny, shivering figure huddled beneath a bush. It was a small, frail old woman, her hair as white as snow and her eyes as clear as the mountain streams.

""Good day, kind woodcutter,"" she said, her voice as thin and reedy as a dried-up reed. ""I have lost my way in these unfamiliar woods. Could you, perhaps, guide me back to my home?""

Hans, being the kind-hearted soul he was, offered to help the old woman. He led her through the forest, chatting amiably about the weather, the village, and the various animals they encountered along the way.

As they neared the village, the old woman stopped suddenly, her eyes wide with fear. ""Oh, dear woodcutter,"" she said, ""I have forgotten my name! I cannot remember who I am or where I live. Please, help me find my identity before we reach the village.""

Hans, though puzzled, promised to help the old woman. ""Let us sit here for a moment,"" he said, leading her to a nearby bench beneath an ancient oak tree. ""Close your eyes and think hard about who you are and where you come from.""

The old woman closed her eyes and sat very still. After a few moments, she opened her eyes and smiled. ""Thank you, kind woodcutter,"" she said. ""I remember now. I am the Fairy Queen of the Black Forest, and my home is deep within these woods. I have been cursed by an evil witch, who stole my memory and my power. But now, with your help, I can return to my home and break the curse.""

Hans was amazed. ""I am honored to have helped you, Your Majesty,"" he said. ""But how can I help you break the curse?""

The Fairy Queen smiled. ""You must journey deep into the heart of the Black Forest and find the witch's lair. There, you must confront the witch and demand that she release me from her curse. But be warned, the witch is powerful and cunning, and she will not give up her prize easily.""

Hans, though hesitant, agreed to help the Fairy Queen. He bid her farewell and set off into the forest, determined to free the Fairy Queen from her curse.

For days, Hans journeyed through the forest, facing numerous challenges and obstacles along the way. He encountered fierce beasts, treacherous terrain, and dark, foreboding caves. But he persevered, driven by his determination to help the Fairy Queen.

Finally, after many days and nights, Hans reached the witch's lair. It was a dark, dank cave, filled with the stench of rot and decay. Hans steeled himself and entered the cave, his heart pounding in his chest.

Inside the cave, he found the witch, a twisted, hag-like figure with long, greasy hair and a wicked, malevolent smile. ""Ah, kind woodcutter,"" she cackled, ""I have been expecting you. You have come to challenge me for the Fairy Queen's freedom, have you not?""

Hans nodded, his voice steady and firm. ""Yes, I have,"" he said. ""I have journeyed far and faced many dangers to free her from your curse. Now, I demand that you release her and allow her to return to her home.""

The witch laughed, a cold, heartless sound. ""Release her, you say? I think not. The Fairy Queen is mine, and I will not let her go without a fight.""

The witch raised her hands, and a swirling vortex of darkness appeared before her. ""Prepare to die, woodcutter,"" she hissed.

But Hans was not afraid. He raised his axe and charged at the witch, swinging it with all his might. The witch dodged and weaved, her laughter echoing through the cave.

For what felt like an eternity, Hans and the witch fought, their battle raging through the cave. Finally, with a mighty swing, Hans struck the witch down, her body crumbling to dust as she hit the ground.

With the witch defeated, the curse on the Fairy Queen was broken. She appeared before Hans, her beauty restored and her power returned. ""Thank you, kind woodcutter,"" she said, her voice filled with gratitude. ""You have saved me and the Black Forest from the witch's evil. I shall never forget your kindness.""

With a wave of her hand, the Fairy Queen returned to her home deep within the Black Forest. Hans, though tired and battered, felt a sense of peace and fulfillment. He had helped the Fairy Queen, and in doing so, he had made a difference in the world.

And so, Hans returned to his village, a hero in the eyes of all who knew him. He continued to live a simple, honest life, always ready to lend a helping hand to those in need. And the Black Forest, once a dark and foreboding place, was transformed into a land of beauty and wonder, a testament to the power of kindness and the triumph of good over evil.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the trees were as old as time itself, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. He was a simple man, content with his life, but he harbored a secret dream. He yearned for something more, something extraordinary.

One day, as Hans was chopping wood in the dense forest, he stumbled upon a peculiar stone. It was not like any stone he had ever seen before. It was shimmering with an ethereal light, and it seemed to be calling out to him. Intrigued, Hans picked up the stone and placed it in his pocket.

That night, as Hans lay in his small, wooden bed, he felt a strange sensation. The stone in his pocket began to glow, and he could feel a strange energy coursing through his veins. He felt a sudden urge to leave his humble home and venture deeper into the forest.

The next morning, Hans woke up with a renewed sense of purpose. He packed a few provisions and set off into the forest, the glowing stone guiding his way. He walked for days, never tiring, never faltering. The forest seemed to be changing around him, becoming more magical, more enchanting.

After many days of walking, Hans came upon a clearing. In the center of the clearing stood a magnificent castle, its towers reaching up to the sky, its walls shimmering with gold. Hans approached the castle, his heart pounding with excitement.

As he approached the castle, the gates swung open, and a beautiful woman emerged. She was more radiant than the sun, her hair as golden as the castle walls, her eyes as blue as the deepest ocean. She introduced herself as the Queen of the Enchanted Forest, and she welcomed Hans into her castle.

Hans spent many days in the castle, feasting, dancing, and enjoying the company of the Queen. But he couldn't shake off the feeling that something was missing. He yearned for something more, something he couldn't quite put his finger on.

One day, as he was walking through the castle gardens, he came upon a old, wise man. The man was sitting on a bench, staring off into the distance. Hans approached the man and asked him what he was doing.

""I am waiting for the one who will free me,"" the old man replied.

""Free you?"" Hans asked, confused.

""Yes, I am cursed to remain here, bound to this bench, until the one who can solve my riddle is found,"" the old man explained.

Hans' curiosity was piqued. ""What is the riddle?"" he asked.

The old man smiled. ""The riddle is simple, yet it has stumped many a wise man. What is it that is so fragile that saying its name breaks it, yet it can withstand the hardest blow?""

Hans thought for a moment, then a smile spread across his face. ""The answer is hope,"" he declared.

The old man's eyes widened in surprise. ""You are the one I have been waiting for,"" he said. ""You have solved my riddle, and as a reward, I will grant you three wishes.""

Hans was overwhelmed. He had always dreamed of having magical powers, and now, here they were, within his grasp. He thought for a moment, then made his wishes.

His first wish was for the Queen of the Enchanted Forest to love him as he loved her. His second wish was for the castle and its magic to remain his forever. His third wish was for the people of his village to live in peace and prosperity.

The old man nodded, and with a wave of his hand, Hans' wishes were granted. He returned to his village, where he was hailed as a hero. The people lived in peace and prosperity, and Hans and the Queen of the Enchanted Forest lived happily ever after.

And so, the story of Hans and the Queen of the Enchanted Forest became a legend, passed down from generation to generation. And every time the story was told, the people of the village would remember the power of hope, and the magic that could be found in the heart of the Black Forest.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, nestled between towering pines and moss-covered boulders, lay a quaint village named Schwarzwald. The villagers were simple folk, living harmoniously with nature and each other. Their days were filled with hard work, laughter, and the occasional mischief.

Among them was a young girl named Greta. She was known for her radiant smile, her quick wit, and her insatiable curiosity. Greta had a special bond with the forest, and she spent most of her days exploring its hidden corners.

One day, while wandering deeper into the forest than she ever had before, Greta stumbled upon a hidden glade. In the center of the glade stood a magnificent tree, its branches reaching out like the arms of a protective father. At the base of the tree lay a small, shimmering pool.

As Greta approached the pool, she noticed a peculiar stone in the center. It was larger than any stone she had ever seen, and it seemed to be pulsating with an inner light. Intrigued, she reached out to touch it.

Suddenly, the ground beneath her feet began to shake, and the sky darkened. A fierce wind whipped through the glade, and the branches of the magnificent tree creaked ominously. Greta felt a cold, clammy hand grip her shoulder, and she knew she was in trouble.

A towering figure emerged from the shadows. It was a giant, with skin the color of charcoal and eyes that glowed like embers. He towered over Greta, and she felt as small as a grain of sand.

""Who dares to disturb my slumber?"" the giant roared. ""I am the Forest Guardian, and this is my domain.""

Greta's heart pounded in her chest, but she stood her ground. ""I mean you no harm, Forest Guardian,"" she said, her voice trembling. ""I merely wished to see the beauty of your glade.""

The giant's eyes narrowed, and he leaned down to look at Greta. ""You speak the truth, child. I sense no malice in your heart. But you have disturbed my rest, and I must be compensated.""

Greta's mind raced. She knew she could not outrun the giant, and she certainly could not outwit him. But she had a cunning mind, and she refused to give up without a fight.

""I will do anything to make amends,"" she said, her voice steady. ""Name your price, and I will fulfill it.""

The giant's eyes widened, and he straightened up, towering over Greta once more. ""Very well,"" he said. ""I will give you three tasks. If you complete them, I will allow you to leave this glade unharmed. But if you fail, you will remain here as my prisoner for all eternity.""

Greta nodded, determined to complete the tasks and return to her village. The giant's first task was simple: he wanted her to find the rarest flower in the Black Forest and bring it back to him. Greta set off immediately, using her knowledge of the forest to guide her.

After hours of searching, she finally found the flower the giant had requested: the elusive Nightingale Blossom. It was a delicate, fragrant flower that bloomed only once a year, under the light of a full moon. Greta carefully picked the flower and returned to the glade.

The giant's second task was more challenging: he wanted her to find the legendary Black Forest Bear and retrieve a single strand of its fur. Greta knew the bear was fierce and dangerous, but she was not one to back down from a challenge.

She spent days tracking the bear, following its footprints and listening for its growls. Finally, she found it: a massive, black bear with eyes that seemed to see through her very soul. Greta approached it slowly, speaking softly and offering it a piece of honey.

The bear sniffed the honey, then licked it from Greta's palm. She reached out and gently stroked its fur, and the bear seemed to sense her good intentions. She carefully plucked a single strand of fur and returned to the glade.

The giant's third and final task was the most difficult: he wanted her to find the Heart of the Forest, a magical artifact said to grant the wielder immense power. Greta knew the Heart of the Forest was guarded by powerful spirits, and she was not sure she could complete this task.

But she was determined to try. She spent days meditating, calling upon the spirits of the forest for guidance. Finally, she felt a surge of energy coursing through her, and she knew she was ready.

She journeyed deep into the heart of the forest, following a path that seemed to twist and turn endlessly. She encountered many challenges along the way, but she persevered, using her wit and her courage to overcome them.

Finally, she reached the Heart of the Forest. It was a small, glowing crystal, pulsating with an inner light. Greta reached out and took it, feeling a surge of power coursing through her.

She returned to the glade, the Heart of the Forest clutched tightly in her hand. The giant's eyes widened in shock, and he reached out to take it from her.

""You have completed your tasks, child,"" he said, his voice heavy with admiration. ""You have proven yourself worthy. I will release you from this glade, but I warn you: the Heart of the Forest is a powerful artifact. Use it wisely.""

Greta nodded, and the giant disappeared back into the shadows. She made her way back to her village, her heart filled with pride and her mind filled with wonder.

From that day on, Greta was known as the Brave One, the girl who had faced the Forest Guardian and lived to tell the tale. She continued to explore the Black Forest, always seeking out new adventures and challenges. And whenever she passed by the hidden glade, she would pause for a moment, remembering the time she had faced the Forest Guardian and won.

","Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between the Black Forest and the Rhine River, there lived a kind and hardworking miller named Hans. He had a beautiful daughter named Greta, who was known throughout the land for her radiant beauty and gentle spirit.

One day, a mysterious stranger arrived in the village. He was tall and thin, with a long, flowing beard and piercing blue eyes. He introduced himself as the King's Advisor and asked for a room at the inn. The villagers were wary of him, but Hans, being a kind-hearted man, offered him a room in his own home.

The Advisor stayed with Hans and Greta for several days, and during that time, he became enamored with the young girl. He asked Hans for her hand in marriage, and although Hans was hesitant, he eventually agreed.

On the day of the wedding, the Advisor revealed his true identity: he was the devil himself. He had come to the village to claim Greta's soul, and he was not about to let a little thing like a wedding ceremony stand in his way.

Greta was terrified, but Hans bravely stood up to the devil. ""You cannot take my daughter,"" he said. ""She is pure of heart and has done nothing to deserve your wrath.""

The devil sneered at Hans and said, ""Very well, if you think you can protect her, then I will give you a test. If you can complete three impossible tasks, I will release Greta and allow her to live a normal life.""

Hans agreed to the devil's terms, and the three tasks were as follows:

1. He must grind an entire mountain of grain into flour in one night.
2. He must catch a golden fish that lived in the Rhine River and bring it back to the devil.
3. He must retrieve a magic cloak that belonged to the devil and bring it back to him.

Hans set to work on the first task, and with the help of the villagers, he was able to grind the entire mountain of grain into flour by dawn.

Next, he set out to catch the golden fish. He built a beautiful net and set it in the Rhine River, and when the fish swam into the net, Hans was able to capture it.

Finally, he set out to retrieve the magic cloak. He journeyed deep into the Black Forest, where he encountered a fierce dragon guarding the cloak. Hans fought the dragon bravely, and with the help of a magical sword that he found in the forest, he was able to defeat the dragon and retrieve the cloak.

When he returned to the devil, he presented the golden fish and the magic cloak, and the devil was forced to release Greta.

Greta and Hans were overjoyed to be reunited, and they lived happily ever after. The villagers celebrated their victory over the devil, and they never forgot the bravery and strength of their miller.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the towering pines kissed the sky and the shadows danced with the moonlight, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. His life was simple, and he loved it that way. He spent his days tending to the forest, and his nights by the warmth of his hearth.

One day, as Hans was chopping wood near the edge of the forest, he heard a soft, melodious sound. He paused, listening intently. The sound was like nothing he had ever heard before, a sweet, haunting melody that seemed to come from the very heart of the forest.

Intrigued, Hans followed the sound deeper into the woods. The trees grew denser, the air cooler, and the shadows grew longer. But Hans was not afraid. He had a feeling that he was meant to find whatever was making that beautiful music.

After what felt like hours, Hans came upon a clearing. In the center of the clearing stood a beautiful, golden-haired maiden. She was dancing gracefully, her movements fluid and mesmerizing. And as she danced, she played a small, silver flute, the source of the beautiful music Hans had heard.

Hans watched in awe as the maiden danced. He had never seen such beauty, such grace. He felt his heart flutter in his chest, and he knew that he had to meet her.

""Fraulein,"" he called out, his voice barely above a whisper. ""I have been following the sound of your music. You are truly beautiful.""

The maiden turned to him, her eyes sparkling with curiosity. ""I have never seen you before, Herr Woodcutter,"" she said. ""Why have you come here?""

""I came to see the source of the beautiful music,"" Hans replied. ""And I must admit, I am also drawn to your beauty.""

The maiden blushed at his compliment. ""I am the Forest Spirit,"" she said. ""I have been dancing and playing my flute to bring joy to the forest. But I have never seen a mortal man in this part of the forest before.""

""I am Hans, a humble woodcutter,"" Hans said. ""I live near the edge of the forest, and I come here to chop wood and gather firewood. But I have never seen a Forest Spirit before.""

The Forest Spirit smiled. ""I have never met a mortal man before either,"" she said. ""But I must warn you, Herr Woodcutter. I am bound to the forest, and I can never leave it. If you try to take me away, I will disappear, and the forest will be cursed.""

Hans nodded, understanding the danger. ""I would never try to take you away from your home,"" he said. ""I just want to spend time with you, to learn from you, and to listen to your beautiful music.""

The Forest Spirit nodded, a soft smile on her face. ""I will allow you to spend time with me, Herr Woodcutter,"" she said. ""But you must promise me that you will never try to take me away.""

Hans promised, and the Forest Spirit led him deeper into the forest, showing him hidden glades and secret pools. She taught him the secrets of the forest, and he learned to appreciate its beauty in a way he never had before.

But as the days turned into weeks, Hans found himself growing more and more attached to the Forest Spirit. He longed to spend every waking moment with her, to hold her in his arms, and to hear her sweet music.

One day, as they sat by a hidden pool, Hans couldn't help but ask, ""Forest Spirit, can't you break the curse that binds you to the forest? Can't we be together forever?""

The Forest Spirit looked at him sadly. ""I wish I could, Herr Woodcutter,"" she said. ""But I am bound to the forest, and I can never leave it. If I try, the forest will be cursed, and I will disappear.""

Hans felt his heart break. ""I understand, Forest Spirit,"" he said. ""But I can't bear the thought of never seeing you again.""

The Forest Spirit took his hand in hers. ""I understand your pain, Herr Woodcutter,"" she said. ""But I must ask you one last favor. Promise me that you will never forget me, and that you will always remember the time we spent together. And promise me that you will tell my story to future generations, so that they too can appreciate the beauty of the forest.""

Hans nodded, tears streaming down his face. ""I promise, Forest Spirit,"" he said. ""I will never forget you, and I will always remember the time we spent together. And I will tell your story to future generations, so that they too can appreciate the beauty of the forest.""

The Forest Spirit smiled, and for a moment, Hans thought she was going to stay with him. But then she stood up, and with a sad goodbye, she disappeared into the shadows of the forest.

Hans was left alone, his heart heavy with sadness. But he knew that he had to keep his promise to the Forest Spirit. He spent the rest of his days telling her story to anyone who would listen, and he dedicated his life to protecting the forest and preserving its beauty.

And so the story of the Forest Spirit and the humble woodcutter lived on, a tale of love and loss, of beauty and sacrifice, and of the magic that lies hidden in the heart of the Black Forest.

","Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between the rolling hills of Bavaria, there lived a humble shoemaker named Hans. He was known throughout the land for his exquisite craftsmanship, and his shoes were sought after by the nobility and the common folk alike.

One day, as Hans was working on a pair of fine leather boots, he noticed a tiny, glowing ember on the floor. He picked it up and, to his surprise, it transformed into a tiny, old man. The old man introduced himself as the spirit of the ember, and he thanked Hans for rescuing him from being extinguished.

""In return for your kindness,"" said the spirit, ""I will grant you three wishes. But be warned, each wish will come with a consequence.""

Hans was taken aback. He had never heard of such a thing before, but he couldn't pass up the opportunity.

""First, I wish for a pair of shoes that can never be worn out,"" said Hans. The spirit nodded, and with a wave of his hand, the boots Hans was working on became indestructible.

""Second, I wish for a never-ending supply of leather and other materials,"" said Hans. Again, the spirit granted his wish, and Hans' workshop was filled with an endless supply of materials.

""Finally, I wish for wealth and prosperity for my family,"" said Hans. The spirit looked at him with a sad smile. ""I'm afraid I cannot grant that wish. For every wish you make, a piece of your soul must be given in return. If you wish for wealth, you must also wish for the loss of a part of your soul.""

Hans thought long and hard about his third wish. He knew that wealth would bring him comfort and security for his family, but he also knew that it would come at a great cost. After much contemplation, he made his decision.

""I wish for wealth and prosperity for my family, but only if it comes with a small piece of my soul,"" said Hans. The spirit nodded and granted his wish.

From that day on, Hans' family lived in comfort and prosperity. But Hans could feel a strange emptiness inside of him. He knew that a part of his soul had been taken, and he couldn't help but feel a sense of loss.

Years passed, and Hans continued to make beautiful shoes. But he could no longer find joy in his work, and he began to feel a deep sense of sadness. He longed for the days when he could create without the weight of his soul hanging over him.

One day, as Hans was working in his workshop, he heard a knock at the door. It was the spirit of the ember.

""I have come to collect the final piece of your soul,"" said the spirit. ""But I see that you are unhappy. Is there anything I can do to help?""

Hans looked at the spirit and sighed. ""I wish I could go back to the way things were before,"" he said. ""I wish I could have my soul back, and I wish I could find joy in my work again.""

The spirit looked at Hans with a kind smile. ""I cannot return your soul to you, but I can help you find joy in your work again. You see, the reason you feel empty is because you have given too much of yourself. But if you are willing to give a little more, I can help you find fulfillment in your work.""

Hans thought about the spirit's words. He knew that he had already given a great deal, but he also knew that he needed to find a way to be happy again.

""I will give you one more piece of my soul,"" said Hans. ""But I want something in return. I want to be able to create without the weight of my soul hanging over me.""

The spirit nodded. ""I can grant your wish. But remember, with great power comes great responsibility. Use your gift wisely, and never let it consume you.""

With that, the spirit took the final piece of Hans' soul and disappeared. Hans felt a strange sense of peace wash over him. He looked at the shoes he was working on, and for the first time in a long time, he felt a sense of joy and fulfillment.

From that day on, Hans' shoes were more beautiful than ever before. People came from far and wide to buy them, and Hans' reputation as a master craftsman spread throughout the land. But Hans never let the fame and fortune get to his head. He knew that he had been given a great gift, and he used it to bring joy and happiness to others.

And so, Hans lived out the rest of his days in peace and contentment, creating beautiful shoes and sharing his gifts with the world. And whenever someone put on a pair of his shoes, they could feel the love and joy that Hans had put into each and every one of them.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the towering pines whispered secrets to the wind, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. His life was simple, and he was content with his solitary existence. But one day, his peaceful world was shattered by an enchanting melody that echoed through the forest, filling his heart with an inexplicable longing.

The melody seemed to come from a hidden glade, where the sun's rays danced upon the golden leaves of the trees. Intrigued, Hans followed the music, and as he ventured deeper into the forest, he found himself standing before a crystal-clear pond. On the water's edge, a beautiful maiden with long, golden hair was playing a small, silver harp.

Hans was captivated by her beauty and the haunting melody that flowed from her harp. He approached her, his heart pounding in his chest. The maiden looked up and smiled, her eyes twinkling with an otherworldly light. ""Greetings, woodcutter,"" she said in a voice that was as sweet as the music she played. ""I am the Water Nymph, and I have been waiting for you.""

Hans was taken aback by her words. ""Waiting for me?"" he stammered. ""But why?""

The Water Nymph sighed, her eyes clouding with sadness. ""I have been cursed by a wicked sorcerer,"" she explained. ""Every day, I am forced to play my harp and enchant all who hear my music. If they do not find true love within a year and a day, they will be trapped in this forest forever, doomed to wander and never find peace.""

Hans' heart ached for the Water Nymph, and he vowed to help her break the curse. ""I will find you true love,"" he declared. ""I will search the entire world if I must, but I will not rest until I have found someone worthy of your heart.""

The Water Nymph smiled, her eyes shining with gratitude. ""Thank you, kind woodcutter,"" she said. ""I have faith that you will find someone worthy of my love. And when you do, return to this glade, and I will know that the curse has been lifted.""

With a final, tender kiss, Hans bid farewell to the Water Nymph and set off on his quest. He traveled far and wide, searching for a man or woman who could break the curse and free the Water Nymph from her eternal torment.

Months turned into years, and still, Hans had found no one. His heart grew heavy with the weight of his failure, and he began to doubt that he would ever find the one who could break the curse. But as he wandered through a dense thicket, he heard the sound of laughter and music.

Following the sound, he came upon a grand ball, where the nobility of the land had gathered to celebrate the coming of spring. In the midst of the crowd, a young woman caught his eye. She was beautiful, with hair as dark as the night and eyes that sparkled like stars. Her laughter was like music to Hans' ears, and he knew in his heart that she was the one he had been searching for.

Approaching the young woman, Hans introduced himself and told her of his quest. She listened intently, her eyes filled with sympathy and determination. ""I will help you, woodcutter,"" she said. ""I will break the curse and free the Water Nymph from her eternal prison.""

Overjoyed, Hans returned to the glade with the young woman by his side. The Water Nymph's eyes lit up with hope as she saw the young woman, and she played her harp once more, filling the air with her enchanting melody.

The young woman listened to the music, her heart swelling with love for the Water Nymph. As the final notes faded away, she turned to Hans and spoke three simple words: ""I love you.""

The Water Nymph's eyes filled with tears as she realized that the curse had been broken. ""Thank you,"" she whispered, her voice filled with gratitude. ""You have given me a gift beyond measure, and I will never forget your kindness.""

With a final, tender kiss, the Water Nymph disappeared, leaving behind a peaceful glade and a grateful heart. Hans and the young woman returned to their world, their hearts filled with love and the knowledge that they had changed the lives of those around them.

And so, the woodcutter and the young woman lived happily ever after, their love a testament to the power of kindness and the magic of true love. The End."

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the trees stood tall and the air was thick with the scent of pine, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. He was a simple man, content with his life, and his only companions were the creatures of the forest.

One day, as Hans was chopping wood near a crystal-clear stream, he heard a soft, melodious voice singing. The voice was so beautiful that it seemed to come from the very heart of the forest itself. Intrigued, Hans followed the sound, and soon he found himself standing before a small, exquisite maiden.

""Who are you?"" Hans asked, his heart pounding with a mixture of fear and awe.

""I am the Forest Queen,"" the maiden replied, her eyes twinkling with mischief. ""I have been searching for someone worthy to be my husband.""

Hans was taken aback. He had never dreamed that he would be chosen by such a beautiful and powerful creature. ""But I am just a woodcutter,"" he stammered. ""I have no wealth or power to offer you.""

The Forest Queen smiled. ""I do not want your wealth or your power. I want your heart.""

Hans hesitated, but the Forest Queen's beauty and charm were too much for him to resist. He agreed to marry her, and they were wed beneath the ancient oak tree in the heart of the forest.

At first, Hans was happy. He lived in a beautiful palace made of ivy and flowers, and he spent his days wandering through the forest with his beloved wife. But as the years passed, Hans began to feel a gnawing sense of unease. He longed for the simple life he had left behind, and he missed the companionship of his fellow humans.

One day, as he was walking through the forest, Hans saw a group of travelers passing by. They were on their way to a nearby town, and Hans felt a sudden longing to join them. He hesitated, torn between his love for the Forest Queen and his longing for the human world.

In the end, Hans could not resist the call of the human world. He said goodbye to the Forest Queen and set off with the travelers. As he walked, he felt a deep sense of regret, but he knew that he had made the right decision.

When he reached the town, Hans found work as a woodcutter once again. He lived a simple, contented life, and he was happy. But he never forgot the Forest Queen, and he often wondered what had become of her.

Years passed, and Hans grew old. One day, as he was chopping wood near the same crystal-clear stream where he had first heard the Forest Queen's voice, he saw her standing before him. She was older now, but her beauty was still undimmed.

""I have come to take you back to the forest,"" she said. ""I have missed you, Hans.""

Hans looked into her eyes and saw the love and longing there. He knew that he could not refuse her. He said goodbye to the human world once more and followed the Forest Queen back to the heart of the Black Forest.

They lived happily ever after, surrounded by the beauty of the forest. And whenever a traveler passed by, they would hear the sound of a soft, melodious voice singing, a reminder of the love that had brought Hans and the Forest Queen together.

The End.

In this traditional German folktale, a humble woodcutter named Hans is chosen by the Forest Queen to be her husband. At first, he is happy, but he soon misses the human world and leaves the Forest Queen to join travelers. He eventually returns to her, and they live happily ever after. This story highlights the power of love and the longing for companionship that is present in all beings, even those as magical as the Forest Queen."

","In the heart of the Black Forest, nestled among towering evergreens and hidden by a veil of mist, lay the quaint village of Schwarzwald. The villagers lived in harmony with nature, their lives dictated by the rhythm of the seasons. However, there was one tale that echoed through the forest, a tale of a witch who lived in the heart of the forest, far from the prying eyes of the villagers.

The witch, known as Hexe Hilda, was feared and revered in equal measure. She was said to possess powers beyond human comprehension, and her wrath was as fierce as the forest storms that swept through the Black Forest. The villagers would often leave offerings at the edge of the forest, hoping to appease her and protect their homes from her wrath.

One day, a young girl named Elise ventured into the forest to gather firewood. As she walked deeper into the forest, she felt a chill run down her spine. She quickened her pace, her heart pounding in her chest. Suddenly, she heard a cackle that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. She froze, her eyes wide with fear.

Hexe Hilda appeared before her, her long, tangled hair blowing in the wind, her eyes glowing like embers. ""Why have you come to my forest, little one?"" she asked, her voice like the rustling of leaves.

Elise, trembling, replied, ""I came to gather firewood, Hexe Hilda. I mean no harm.""

The witch regarded her for a moment, her eyes narrowing. ""I see,"" she said, her voice softening. ""But tell me, little one, do you believe in me?""

Elise hesitated, unsure of what to say. She had grown up hearing tales of the witch, but she had never seen her before. ""I... I don't know, Hexe Hilda,"" she finally said.

The witch smiled, a chilling sight. ""That is a wise answer, little one. But I will give you a chance to prove your faith. If you can find the hidden treasure that lies within my forest, I will grant you a wish.""

Elise's eyes widened with excitement. ""Really?"" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

""Yes, little one,"" the witch said. ""But be warned, the forest is treacherous, and many have tried and failed. But if you are truly worthy, you will find the treasure.""

Elise nodded, her heart pounding with excitement. She thanked the witch and set off into the forest, determined to find the hidden treasure.

She wandered for days, her feet sore and her body aching. She encountered many dangers, from wild animals to treacherous terrain, but she pressed on, driven by her desire to prove herself to Hexe Hilda.

One day, as she was wandering through a dense thicket, she stumbled upon a small, hidden clearing. In the center of the clearing was a large, ornate chest, its surface covered in intricate carvings. Elise's heart raced as she approached the chest, her hands shaking as she opened it.

Inside, she found a single, golden apple. It was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen, its surface shimmering like liquid gold. She picked it up, her heart swelling with joy. She had done it. She had found the hidden treasure.

She made her way back to the village, the golden apple clutched tightly in her hand. The villagers gasped when they saw her, their eyes wide with awe. Elise held up the apple, a proud smile on her face.

""I have done it,"" she said, her voice shaking with excitement. ""I have found Hexe Hilda's hidden treasure.""

The villagers cheered, their voices ringing through the forest. Elise made her way to the edge of the forest, where she found Hexe Hilda waiting for her.

""You have done well, little one,"" the witch said, her voice softer than Elise had ever heard it before. ""You have proven yourself worthy. What is your wish?""

Elise thought for a moment, her mind racing. She could wish for anything, and for a moment, she considered wishing for riches or power. But then she thought of her family, of the love and support they had given her throughout her life.

""I wish for the happiness and health of my family,"" she said, her voice steady and sure.

The witch nodded, a smile on her face. ""So be it,"" she said. ""Your wish is granted.""

Elise returned to her village, the golden apple forgotten. She found her family waiting for her, their faces filled with concern. She smiled, her heart swelling with love.

From that day on, Elise was known as the bravest and wisest of the villagers. And as for Hexe Hilda, she was no longer feared, but respected. For she had seen the true worth of a human heart, and she had been moved by it.

And so, the tale of Elise and Hexe Hilda was passed down through the generations, a reminder of the power of courage and the importance of love. And every time the villagers ventured into the forest, they would remember the story of the brave girl who had dared to challenge the witch, and they would remember the witch who had granted her wish.

One morning, as Hans was chopping wood near a crystal-clear stream, he heard a soft, melodious voice. It was coming from a tiny, golden bird perched on a nearby branch. The bird sang a hauntingly beautiful song, its voice echoing through the forest.

""Who are you, little bird?"" asked Hans, captivated by the bird's enchanting melody.

""I am the Golden Nightingale,"" replied the bird. ""I have lost my voice, and I cannot sing my songs anymore. If you can find the hidden Water of Life, I will reward you with a treasure beyond your wildest dreams.""

Hans was intrigued. He had heard tales of the Water of Life, a magical spring said to grant eternal youth and happiness. He decided to embark on a quest to find the elusive water.

His journey led him through treacherous mountains, dense forests, and dark caves. Along the way, he encountered various creatures and faced numerous challenges. But Hans was determined, and he pressed on, guided by the memory of the Golden Nightingale's beautiful song.

After many days and nights, Hans finally reached a hidden glade. In the center of the glade was a sparkling spring, its water shimmering with an ethereal glow. This was the Water of Life.

Hans knelt by the spring and scooped up a handful of the water. He returned to the Golden Nightingale, who sang a song of gratitude as her voice was restored.

""Now, as promised, I shall reward you,"" said the bird. ""Choose one of the three treasures I offer: eternal youth, endless wealth, or true love.""

Hans thought long and hard about his choice. He had a simple life, and he was content with it. He did not desire wealth or eternal youth. Instead, he chose true love.

The Golden Nightingale smiled and transformed into a beautiful maiden. ""I am the Fairy Queen,"" she said. ""I have been enchanted by a wicked sorcerer, and I cannot leave this glade. I shall grant you true love, but you must promise to return every year on this day to sing to me and keep me company.""

Hans agreed, and he returned to his home in the Black Forest, his heart filled with joy. He lived a long, happy life, always remembering the Fairy Queen and the magical day he found the Water of Life.

And so, every year on this day, Hans would return to the hidden glade, singing to the Fairy Queen and keeping his promise. The End.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the trees stood tall and the air was thick with the scent of pine, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. He was a kind and gentle soul, beloved by all who knew him. But Hans had a secret, a secret that lay hidden in the depths of the forest, in a secluded glade where the sunlight dappled the ground and the birds sang sweetly.

In this glade, there stood an ancient oak tree, its gnarled roots stretching out like the arms of a long-forgotten giant. And in the hollow of this tree, there lived a magical creature, a tiny, shimmering fairy no larger than a child's finger.

Hans had discovered the fairy one day while chopping wood, and he had been enchanted by her beauty and her grace. He had vowed to protect her and to keep her secret, and so he visited her every day, bringing her gifts of fresh flowers and sweet honey.

But one day, as Hans approached the glade, he saw that the fairy was not there. He searched the entire glade, calling out her name, but she was nowhere to be found.

Days turned into weeks, and still the fairy did not return. Hans grew worried, for he knew that something was amiss. He decided to venture deeper into the forest, to seek out the fairy and bring her back to the safety of her home.

As he walked, Hans came upon a clearing where a magnificent castle stood, its spires reaching up towards the heavens. He had never seen such a sight before, and he was filled with awe and wonder.

As he approached the castle, he heard the sound of laughter and music coming from within. He hesitated for a moment, for he knew that he was not welcome there, but his concern for the fairy overcame his fear.

He pushed open the castle doors and stepped inside, and he was greeted by a sight that was both beautiful and terrifying. Before him stood a group of fairies, their wings shimmering like the wings of angels, and they were dancing and laughing with a group of handsome princes.

Hans approached the fairy who he believed to be his own, but she did not recognize him. Instead, she introduced him to the queen of the fairies, a regal and majestic creature who wore a crown of flowers and a gown of shimmering silk.

The queen explained that the fairy Hans had known was now one of her handmaidens, and that she had been taken away because she had been found by a mortal. The fairies could not abide by mortals, for they believed that they would bring only harm and sorrow.

But Hans would not give up. He pleaded with the queen, telling her of his love for the fairy and of his promise to protect her. The queen was moved by his words, and she agreed to let the fairy return to him, on one condition.

""You must promise never to reveal my existence to any other mortal,"" she said. ""If you do, I will take away your life and your soul, and you will be cursed to wander the earth for all eternity.""

Hans agreed, and the fairy was returned to him. She was overjoyed to see him, and she thanked him for his bravery and his love.

From that day on, Hans and the fairy lived happily ever after, deep in the heart of the Black Forest. They would visit the castle from time to time, but they always kept their promise, never revealing the existence of the fairies to any other mortal.

And so the story of Hans and the fairy was passed down from generation to generation, a tale of love and magic that would never be forgotten.

The End.

","In a small village nestled between the dense, verdant forests of the Black Forest, there lived an old woman named Frau Holle. She was a mysterious figure, known for her extraordinary powers and her ability to control the weather. The villagers would often see her flying through the skies, her long, white hair streaming behind her like a banner, and her eyes twinkling with mischief and wisdom.

One day, a young girl named Maria, who was known for her curiosity and adventurous spirit, decided to seek out Frau Holle. She had heard tales of the old woman's powers and wanted to see them for herself. With a heart full of excitement and a basket filled with freshly baked bread and fruits, Maria set off into the forest.

The forest was dark and foreboding, but Maria was not afraid. She followed the path deeper and deeper into the woods, her heart pounding with anticipation. After what felt like hours, she came to a clearing where she saw a small, old woman sitting on a rock.

""Frau Holle?"" Maria asked, her voice trembling.

The old woman looked up and smiled. ""Yes, child, I am Frau Holle. What brings you here?""

""I have heard tales of your powers, and I wanted to see them for myself,"" Maria replied.

Frau Holle chuckled. ""Very well, but be warned, not everyone who seeks me out is granted their wish. You must prove yourself worthy.""

""I will do anything,"" Maria said, her eyes shining with determination.

""Very well,"" Frau Holle said. ""I have a task for you. In my house, there is a room filled with laundry. You must sort it all and have it finished by sunset. If you can do this, I will grant you a wish.""

Maria nodded eagerly and followed Frau Holle to her house, a quaint little cottage hidden among the trees. Inside, the house was dark and musty, and the smell of damp clothes filled the air.

Maria began to sort the laundry, piles of clothes growing higher and higher around her. She worked tirelessly, her hands aching and her back sore, but she knew she had to finish before sunset.

As the sun began to set, Maria was still sorting the last of the clothes. She looked up and saw that the sky was turning a deep shade of red and orange. She knew she had to hurry.

With a final push, Maria finished sorting the laundry and called out to Frau Holle. The old woman appeared and looked at the piles of clothes.

""Very well, child,"" she said. ""You have proven yourself worthy. What is your wish?""

Maria thought for a moment. She could wish for wealth, or power, or fame, but she knew that what she really wanted was to help her family.

""I wish for my family to have a bountiful harvest this year,"" she said.

Frau Holle nodded and granted Maria's wish. ""So be it,"" she said. ""Your family will have a bountiful harvest this year.""

With a flash of light, Maria was back in the forest, the cottage and Frau Holle disappearing behind her. She made her way back to the village, her heart filled with joy and anticipation.

True to Frau Holle's word, the harvest was bountiful that year. The fields were filled with ripe, golden wheat, and the barns were overflowing with fruits and vegetables. Maria's family was overjoyed, and they thanked her for her wish.

From that day on, Maria was known as the girl who sought out Frau Holle and was granted a wish. She lived out her days in the village, always helping her family and the other villagers, and she never forgot the lesson she learned that day in the forest.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the towering pine trees touched the sky, and the shadows danced with the moonlight, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. His cabin was nestled among the trees, a simple abode made of logs and thatch, yet it was warm and welcoming, filled with the aroma of fresh-baked bread and the crackling fire.

Hans was a kind-hearted man, loved by all the villagers. He was a hard worker, spending his days chopping wood and tending to his small garden. But he was also a lonely man, for he had no family to share his life with. His only companion was a small, talkative bird named Frieda, who lived in a nest in the rafters of his cabin.

One day, as Hans was returning from the forest, he stumbled upon a peculiar sight. A tiny, golden-haired girl, no older than five, was standing alone in the middle of the path. She was dressed in a shimmering white dress, and her eyes were as blue as the summer sky. Hans approached her slowly, not wanting to frighten the child.

""Hello, little one,"" he said softly. ""What are you doing all alone out here?""

The girl looked up at him with wide, innocent eyes. ""I am lost,"" she whispered. ""I can't find my way home.""

Hans' heart went out to the child. He offered to help her find her way, and the girl took his hand, leading him deeper into the forest. They walked for hours, but the girl seemed to know exactly where she was going.

As they walked, Hans couldn't help but notice that the girl never seemed to tire. She skipped and danced along the path, her laughter ringing through the trees. Frieda flew alongside them, singing a merry tune.

Finally, they arrived at a clearing, and there, standing at the edge of a sparkling lake, was a beautiful palace made of crystal and gold. The girl's eyes shone with joy as she ran towards the palace, and Hans followed, his heart pounding with excitement.

As they entered the palace, they were greeted by a grand ballroom, filled with people dancing and laughing. The music was enchanting, and Hans felt as if he had stepped into a dream. The girl ran to a group of children, who greeted her with open arms, and Hans found himself surrounded by a crowd of friendly faces.

He spent the evening dancing and laughing with the people of the palace, forgetting all about his lonely life in the forest. But as the night wore on, he began to feel a strange sense of unease. He couldn't shake the feeling that something was not right.

Finally, he approached the girl, who was sitting on a velvet cushion, surrounded by her friends. ""I must go,"" he said softly. ""I have a cabin to tend to, and I must get an early start in the morning.""

The girl looked up at him with sad eyes. ""I don't want you to go,"" she said. ""I want you to stay here with me.""

Hans felt a pang of longing in his heart. He wanted to stay, to be a part of this magical world, but he knew that he couldn't. ""I'm sorry, little one,"" he said. ""I have a life to live, and I must return to it.""

The girl nodded, her eyes filling with tears. ""I understand,"" she said. ""But promise me that you will come back for me one day.""

Hans promised her that he would, and with a heavy heart, he left the palace and made his way back to his cabin. He spent the rest of the night tossing and turning, unable to shake the image of the golden-haired girl from his mind.

The next morning, Hans woke up early and set out for the forest, determined to find the palace again. He searched for hours, but he couldn't find a trace of it. He searched for days, and then weeks, but the palace was gone, as if it had never been there.

Hans returned to his cabin, his heart heavy with disappointment. He missed the golden-haired girl, and he couldn't shake the feeling that he had made a terrible mistake. But he had a life to live, and he couldn't dwell on what might have been.

Years passed, and Hans grew old. He continued to work hard, tending to his cabin and the forest, but he never forgot about the golden-haired girl. He often thought about the promise he had made to her, and he wondered if he would ever see her again.

One day, as he was chopping wood, he heard a familiar sound. It was the sound of laughter, and he followed it to the edge of the forest. There, standing at the edge of the lake, was the golden-haired girl, just as he had remembered her.

Hans' heart leaped with joy, and he ran towards her, his eyes filled with tears. ""I've come back for you,"" he said, taking her hand. ""I've come back for you, my dear.""

The girl looked up at him with a smile that lit up the forest. ""I knew you would,"" she said. ""I've been waiting for you.""

And with that, Hans and the golden-haired girl walked hand in hand into the palace, ready to start a new life together. The End."

","In the heart of the Black Forest, nestled among ancient oaks and towering pines, stood a quaint little village known as Heimat. The villagers lived simple lives, content with their daily chores and the warmth of their hearths. Yet, they were not oblivious to the tales of the forest, the stories that whispered through the trees, and the legends that echoed in the night.

One such tale was about the Forest King, a majestic stag with a crown of antlers that shimmered in the moonlight. He was said to roam the forest, protecting it from harm and bestowing blessings upon those who respected its beauty.

In Heimat, there lived a young girl named Elise. She was known for her kindness and her love for the forest. Every day, she would venture into the woods, gathering berries and herbs, and singing to the birds. The animals loved her melodies and would often follow her, their curiosity piqued by her sweet voice.

One day, as Elise was wandering deeper into the forest than she ever had before, she stumbled upon a clearing. In the center of the clearing stood a magnificent stag, his antlers gleaming with a strange, ethereal light. Elise gasped in awe, her heart pounding in her chest.

The stag looked at her, his eyes filled with an intelligence that belied his wild nature. He spoke, his voice deep and resonant, ""You are the first human I have ever allowed to see me. I have watched you from the shadows, and I have seen the love you have for this forest. I am the Forest King, and I grant you a wish.""

Elise was taken aback. She had heard of the Forest King, but she never believed she would meet him. She thought for a moment, her mind racing with possibilities. ""I wish for the well-being of my village,"" she said finally. ""I wish for peace and prosperity to reign in Heimat.""

The Forest King nodded, a smile playing on his lips. ""So be it,"" he said. ""From this day forward, Heimat will flourish. The crops will be bountiful, the rivers will run clear, and the villagers will live in harmony.""

With a flick of his tail, the Forest King disappeared into the forest, leaving Elise alone in the clearing. She felt a sense of peace wash over her, a feeling that everything was right with the world.

True to the Forest King's word, Heimat began to change. The crops grew tall and strong, the rivers ran clear, and the villagers lived in harmony. Elise was hailed as a hero, her kindness and love for the forest making her the heart of the village.

Years passed, and Elise grew old. She continued to sing to the birds and wander the forest, her love for it never waning. One day, as she sat by the river, she felt a gentle touch on her shoulder. She turned to see the Forest King, his antlers now silvered with age.

""I have come to grant you another wish,"" he said. ""You have lived a long and fulfilling life, and it is time for you to rest. I will take you to my realm, where you will live among the trees and the animals for all eternity.""

Elise smiled, her eyes filled with tears. ""I would be honored,"" she said. And with that, she closed her eyes and let the Forest King lead her into the heart of the forest, where she would live out her days in peace and harmony.

The End.

This story is a beautiful and enchanting tale that showcases the power of love, kindness, and respect for nature. The Forest King, a symbol of the natural world, rewards Elise for her love and care for the forest, granting her wish and ensuring the prosperity of her village. The story's ending, with Elise being taken to the Forest King's realm, provides a sense of closure and peace, leaving readers with a feeling of contentment and wonder."

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the trees were as old as time itself, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. His life was simple, and he was content with his solitary existence, chopping wood and tending to his small cottage.

One day, as Hans was out in the forest, he heard a faint, melodious sound that seemed to come from the depths of the woods. Intrigued, he followed the sound, and as he ventured deeper, he found himself standing before a small, hidden glade.

In the center of the glade stood a beautiful maiden, her hair as golden as the sun, and her eyes as blue as the summer sky. She was singing a hauntingly beautiful song, and as Hans listened, he felt a strange sense of peace wash over him.

The maiden, noticing Hans, stopped singing and looked at him with curiosity. ""Who are you?"" she asked. ""I am Hans, the woodcutter,"" he replied. ""And what are you doing in this hidden glade?"" she inquired. ""I was following the sound of your beautiful voice,"" he answered.

The maiden smiled, and her eyes twinkled with mischief. ""I am the spirit of the forest, and I have been searching for someone worthy to grant a wish. You have shown kindness and curiosity, so I will grant you three wishes. But be warned, each wish comes with a price.""

Hans was taken aback. He had never heard of such a thing, but he could not pass up the opportunity. ""I wish for a never-ending supply of wood,"" he said. The spirit nodded, and a vast forest appeared before him, filled with trees that would never run out.

""I wish for a beautiful wife,"" Hans said next. The spirit nodded again, and a woman as beautiful as the forest spirit herself appeared by his side. She was kind and loving, and Hans was overjoyed.

But as the third wish approached, Hans hesitated. He thought of wealth, power, and immortality, but none of those things seemed as important as they once did. ""I wish for happiness and peace for all who live in the Black Forest,"" he said finally.

The spirit nodded, and a sense of contentment and harmony spread throughout the forest. Animals lived in harmony, and the people who lived there were happy and prosperous.

But as the years passed, Hans began to notice a change. The forest was no longer as vibrant as it once was, and the people who lived there seemed to be losing their sense of wonder and joy. Hans realized that the price for his third wish was that he would never again experience true happiness himself.

He went to the spirit and asked her to take back his wish, but the spirit refused. ""You have brought happiness and peace to the Black Forest, but true happiness cannot be forced upon others. It must be earned through hardship and struggle.""

Hans returned to his cottage, and he lived out the rest of his days in quiet contentment. He knew that he would never again experience the same joy that he had felt when he first heard the forest spirit's song, but he was at peace with his decision.

And so, the story of Hans the woodcutter and the spirit of the forest became a legend, passed down from generation to generation. It served as a reminder that true happiness cannot be forced, and that sometimes, the greatest sacrifices are the ones that bring the most peace.

The End.

This story is a traditional German folktale called ""The Spirit of the Forest."" It is a tale that explores the themes of sacrifice, contentment, and the true nature of happiness. The story of Hans the woodcutter serves as a reminder that true happiness cannot be forced upon others and that sometimes, the greatest sacrifices are the ones that bring the most peace.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, nestled between towering pines and whispering oaks, lay the quaint village of Schwarzwald. The villagers lived in harmony with nature, their lives intertwined with the rhythm of the seasons. But beneath the tranquil surface of their idyllic existence, a dark secret lay hidden.

Deep within the forest, a wicked witch named Hexenfrau resided in a hidden cave. She was feared by all, for her powers were as dark as the forest night. She could summon storms, control the minds of men, and even raise the dead. But her greatest power was her ability to transform herself into any creature she desired.

One day, a young girl named Greta wandered too far into the forest. As the sun began to set, she found herself lost and afraid. The forest grew dark and cold, and she could hear the distant howls of wolves. Suddenly, she felt a cold hand on her shoulder. She turned around to see Hexenfrau, her face twisted into a hideous grin.

""Greta, my dear,"" the witch cackled, ""I have been waiting for you. I have a task for you, and if you complete it, I will grant you three wishes.""

Greta's heart raced with fear, but she knew that she had no choice. ""What must I do?"" she asked, her voice trembling.

""I have lost my most precious possession,"" the witch said, ""a golden apple that grants eternal youth. It was stolen by a mischievous sprite. You must find it for me, and bring it back to me within three days, or I will curse you and your family forever.""

Greta nodded, her mind racing with fear and determination. She set off into the forest, her heart heavy with dread.

For three days, Greta searched the forest, her eyes scanning every tree and bush. On the third day, as the sun began to set, she heard a faint tinkling sound. Following the sound, she found herself at the edge of a crystal-clear lake. In the center of the lake, suspended in mid-air, was a golden apple.

As she reached for the apple, a tiny sprite appeared before her. ""You cannot have that apple,"" the sprite said, ""it is mine.""

""But it belongs to the witch Hexenfrau,"" Greta said, ""and she will curse me and my family if I do not bring it back to her.""

""I do not care,"" the sprite said, ""I will not give it up without a fight.""

Greta knew that she could not defeat the sprite in a fair fight, but she was determined to save her family. She closed her eyes and whispered a secret incantation that her grandmother had taught her. As she opened her eyes, she found herself transformed into a beautiful swan.

The sprite laughed and flew towards her, but Greta was faster. She spread her wings and took to the air, pursuing the sprite across the lake. The sprite was quick, but Greta was faster. She soon caught up to the sprite and plucked the golden apple from its grasp.

As she flew back to the village, she felt a sense of triumph. She had completed her task, and she would be able to save her family. But as she approached the village, she saw smoke rising from the chimneys. The villagers were gathered in the town square, their faces pale with fear.

""Greta!"" they cried, ""The witch Hexenfrau has returned! She has cursed the village and all its inhabitants!""

Greta's heart sank, but she knew that she had to try. She transformed back into her human form and ran to the witch's cave. Inside, she found the witch, her face twisted with rage.

""You have defied me, Greta,"" the witch hissed, ""and for that, you will pay.""

Greta stood her ground, the golden apple clutched tightly in her hand. ""I have completed your task, witch,"" she said, ""and now I demand that you lift the curse from my family and the village.""

The witch's eyes narrowed, and for a moment, Greta thought that she would attack. But then, the witch's face softened, and she sighed. ""Very well,"" she said, ""I will lift the curse, but only if you promise to never speak of this day again.""

Greta nodded, her heart still racing with fear and relief. The witch waved her hand, and the curse was lifted. The villagers cheered, and Greta knew that she had saved them all.

As she walked back to her home, she looked up at the stars and whispered a silent prayer of thanks. She had faced her greatest fear, and she had emerged victorious. She knew that she would never forget this day, and the lesson it had taught her.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, nestled among towering pines and ancient oaks, lay the quaint village of Schwarzwald. The villagers lived in harmony with nature, their lives intertwined with the rhythm of the seasons.

One winter, a terrible blizzard swept through the forest, leaving Schwarzwald isolated and cold. The villagers huddled in their homes, their hearts heavy with worry. The crops had failed, and food was scarce. The children cried for want of bread, and the elderly trembled with cold.

In the midst of this despair, a mysterious old woman appeared in the village square. She was tall and gaunt, with a face like the moon and eyes that glimmered like stars. She wore a cloak of raven feathers and a hat adorned with silver bells.

The villagers gathered around her, their eyes wide with curiosity and fear. The old woman spoke in a voice like the wind, promising them a bountiful harvest if they would give her their firstborn child.

The villagers were torn. They knew the old woman was a witch, but they also knew they had no other choice. One by one, they agreed to her terms, their hearts heavy with sorrow.

As the spring came, the villagers watched in awe as their fields bloomed with crops they had not sown. The harvest was bountiful, and the village was saved.

But as the first snowflakes of winter began to fall, the old woman returned. She stood in the village square, her cloak billowing around her, her silver bells jingling.

The villagers gathered around her, their eyes filled with fear and regret. The old woman looked at them, her eyes cold and hard.

""You have kept your end of the bargain,"" she said. ""Now it is time for you to fulfill yours.""

The villagers looked at each other, their hearts heavy with sorrow. They knew they had no choice but to give the old woman their firstborn child.

One by one, the children were led away, their eyes filled with tears. The villagers watched as the old woman disappeared into the forest, her cloak billowing behind her.

The village was silent for a long time. The villagers mourned their lost children, their hearts filled with regret and sorrow.

But as the years passed, the villagers began to notice something strange. The children who had been taken by the old woman returned, as if from a dream. They were older, wiser, and stronger than their peers. They spoke of strange lands and magical creatures, and the villagers marveled at their tales.

The children who had been taken by the old woman were not the same as the ones who had been left behind. They were changed, transformed by their time in the witch's care.

The villagers came to realize that the old woman had not been a witch, but a guardian, a protector of the village. She had taken their children to a magical land, where they had learned the secrets of the forest and the ways of the world.

The villagers learned to live with their loss, to find solace in the knowledge that their children were safe and happy. They learned to appreciate the gifts that the old woman had given them, and to cherish the children who had returned to them, changed and transformed.

And so, the villagers of Schwarzwald lived out their days, their lives intertwined with the rhythm of the seasons, their hearts filled with love and gratitude for the mysterious old woman who had saved their village.

The End.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, nestled between towering pine trees and hidden from the world, lay a quaint village named Schwarzwald. The villagers were simple folk, living in harmony with nature, and their lives were filled with the rhythm of the seasons.

One day, as the first snowflakes began to fall, a young girl named Greta ventured into the forest to gather firewood. She was a curious child, always eager to explore, and today was no exception. As she walked deeper into the forest, she stumbled upon a small, hidden clearing. In the center of the clearing stood an ancient, gnarled oak tree, its branches reaching out as if to embrace the sky.

Greta approached the tree, her heart pounding with excitement. As she touched its rough bark, she felt a strange sensation, as if the tree were speaking to her. She strained her ears, listening intently, and suddenly, she heard a voice, soft and melodic, whispering in her mind.

""Greta, I am the Tree of Wishes. I have been here for centuries, granting the desires of those who seek me. But I can only grant one wish to each person, and it must be a wish of the heart, not of the mind.""

Greta was taken aback. She had never heard of such a tree before, but she felt a strange, inexplicable trust in the voice. ""I wish for my family to be safe and happy,"" she said, her voice barely a whisper.

The tree nodded, its branches swaying gently. ""Your wish is granted, Greta. But remember, with every wish, a price must be paid.""

Greta returned to her village, her heart filled with joy. Her family was indeed safe and happy, and she felt a sense of peace she had never known before. But as the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, she began to notice changes.

The villagers were no longer content with their simple lives. They began to covet the possessions of their neighbors, and soon, jealousy and greed took root in their hearts. Greta watched in horror as her once peaceful village was torn apart by discord and strife.

One day, as she sat by the fire, the Tree of Wishes appeared to her in a vision. ""I warned you, Greta,"" it said. ""With every wish, a price must be paid. The peace and happiness you wished for your family came at a cost to the village. Now, you must find a way to restore balance.""

Greta knew what she had to do. She gathered the villagers and spoke to them of the importance of contentment and gratitude. She reminded them of the beauty of their simple lives and the joy of living in harmony with nature. Slowly, the villagers began to listen, and the discord in their hearts began to fade.

It was a long and difficult journey, but Greta never gave up. She worked tirelessly, healing the rifts that had formed and mending the broken bonds between the villagers. And as the snow melted and the first flowers bloomed, the village of Schwarzwald was once again filled with peace and happiness.

Greta knew that the Tree of Wishes had taught her a valuable lesson. She had learned that true happiness comes not from material possessions, but from the love and harmony that exists within a community. And as she looked out at the villagers, laughing and working together, she knew that her wish had been granted in a way she could never have imagined.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the towering pines whispered secrets to the wind, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. His life was simple, his days filled with the rhythmic chop of his axe and the gentle rustle of the leaves. But the forest, as beautiful as it was, held a secret, a secret that would change Hans' life forever.

One day, as Hans was cutting wood, he heard a faint melody, a hauntingly beautiful song that seemed to emanate from the very heart of the forest. Intrigued, he followed the sound, his heart pounding with anticipation. The deeper he ventured, the clearer the song became, until he found himself standing before a small, hidden glade.

In the center of the glade stood a tree unlike any other, its branches adorned with golden leaves that shimmered in the sunlight. At its base, a crystal clear spring bubbled up, and it was from this spring that the enchanting melody emanated.

As Hans approached, he saw a tiny, delicate figure standing beside the tree. She was no more than a few inches tall, with hair as golden as the leaves on the tree, and eyes as blue as the sky. She was the most beautiful creature Hans had ever seen.

""Who are you?"" Hans asked, his voice barely a whisper.

""I am the Forest Queen,"" she replied, her voice as sweet as the song she had been singing. ""I have been waiting for someone worthy to find this place. You have a kind heart, Hans, and I have a task for you.""

""Anything,"" Hans said, his eyes filled with wonder.

""There is a wicked witch who lives in a castle on the other side of the forest. She has stolen the Golden Apple, the source of my power. I need you to retrieve it for me.""

Hans hesitated, unsure if he was up to the task. But the Forest Queen read his thoughts. ""Do not worry, Hans. I will help you. Take this golden acorn. When you need my help, simply plant it, and I will appear.""

With a newfound sense of purpose, Hans set off towards the witch's castle. The journey was long and treacherous, but Hans was determined. He faced many challenges, from fierce beasts to treacherous terrain, but he persevered.

Finally, he reached the castle, its towers looming ominously in the twilight. With a deep breath, Hans climbed the castle walls, his heart pounding in his chest. Inside, he found the witch, a twisted, haggard old woman, surrounded by dark magic.

""Give me back the Golden Apple,"" Hans demanded, his voice steady despite his fear.

The witch laughed, a cold, cruel sound. ""You think you can take it from me? You are but a mere mortal.""

But Hans was not deterred. With a swift movement, he snatched the Golden Apple from the witch's grasp and turned to leave.

""You will regret this,"" the witch hissed, her eyes filled with malice.

Hans raced back to the glade, the witch's curse echoing in his ears. He planted the golden acorn, and the Forest Queen appeared.

""Quickly, Hans, we must leave. The witch will not rest until she has her revenge.""

Together, they fled, the witch's wrath hot on their heels. They ran for what felt like hours, until they reached the edge of the forest. The Forest Queen took the Golden Apple and thanked Hans.

""You have done a great service, Hans. I will reward you with a wish.""

Hans thought for a moment. He could ask for wealth or power, but he knew what he truly wanted. ""I wish for a loving family.""

The Forest Queen smiled. ""So be it. From this day forward, you will be blessed with a loving wife and children. You will live a long, happy life, and your descendants will be known far and wide.""

With that, the Forest Queen disappeared, leaving Hans standing in the clearing. He turned and walked back into the forest, his heart filled with gratitude and hope.

And so, Hans lived out his days in the Black Forest, his life filled with love and happiness. His descendants would become known as the Schwarzwälder, the people of the Black Forest, and their stories would be told for generations to come.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the towering pines whispered secrets to the wind, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. His life was simple, spent in the rhythm of the forest, cutting firewood, and tending to his small cottage.

One day, as Hans was returning from the forest, he stumbled upon a tiny, shimmering object nestled among the fallen leaves. It was a golden ball, no larger than his fist, and it radiated a warm, inviting glow. Intrigued, he picked it up and felt a sudden surge of energy coursing through his veins.

As he walked home, the forest seemed to come alive. The trees swayed in time with a melody only he could hear, and the animals bowed their heads in respect as he passed. Arriving at his cottage, he found a sumptuous feast laid out on the table, with a steaming mug of ale beside it.

For days, Hans lived in this enchanted state, feasting on the finest foods and basking in the adoration of the forest creatures. But as the days turned into weeks, he began to miss the simplicity of his old life. The enchantment, once a source of wonder, now felt like a prison.

One night, as he lay awake, he heard a soft voice whispering in his ear. It was the voice of the forest, and it spoke to him of a way to break the spell. ""The golden ball is the key,"" it said. ""Take it to the witch in the valley, and she will free you.""

The next morning, Hans set off on his journey, carrying the golden ball with him. The forest, once friendly, now seemed hostile, its trees twisting and contorting as he passed. But he pressed on, driven by the promise of freedom.

After three days of travel, he reached the valley and found the witch's hut at its heart. She was an old, hunchbacked woman with eyes as cold as ice. She took one look at the golden ball and cackled with delight.

""You have come to me, Hans, seeking freedom,"" she said. ""But the golden ball is not yours to keep. It is a gift from the forest, a token of its power. To take it is to betray it.""

Hans hesitated, torn between the allure of the enchanted life and the longing for his old, simple existence. But in the end, he knew what he had to do. He handed the golden ball back to the witch, and she snatched it with a greedy grin.

As she took the ball, the enchantment broke, and the forest returned to its normal state. Hans was once again a humble woodcutter, living in a small cottage in the Black Forest. But he was free, and he knew that true freedom was not found in riches or adoration, but in the simple, honest life he had chosen.

And so, Hans lived out his days, content in the knowledge that he had chosen wisely. The forest, once a prison, was now his home, and he loved it as he had never loved anything before. And when his time came to leave this world, the forest creatures gathered around his cottage, bowing their heads in respect, just as they had done on that fateful day when he had found the golden ball.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, nestled between towering pines and misty valleys, lay a quaint village called Schwarzwald. The villagers lived in harmony with nature, their lives intertwined with the rhythm of the seasons. Among them was a humble shoemaker named Hans.

Hans was known for his craftsmanship, creating shoes that were as comfortable as they were beautiful. But there was one pair of shoes he could not make, no matter how hard he tried. The shoes were for the elusive Wildermann, a creature said to dwell in the deepest parts of the forest.

The Wildermann was a tall, hulking figure with the strength of a thousand men and the agility of a deer. He had a thick, shaggy coat of fur, sharp claws, and a pair of piercing, emerald-green eyes. He was the guardian of the forest, protecting it from harm, but he was also known to be as stubborn as a mule.

One day, a young girl named Greta approached Hans with a peculiar request. ""Hans,"" she said, ""I have heard of your struggle to make the Wildermann's shoes. I believe I can help you. I have a secret recipe that has been passed down through generations. It is said that if you follow it precisely, you will be able to create the perfect pair of shoes for the Wildermann.""

Hans, intrigued and hopeful, agreed to give it a try. Greta handed him a scroll with the recipe written in ancient runes. He spent days and nights studying it, gathering the necessary ingredients, and working tirelessly on the shoes.

Finally, the day came when Hans presented the shoes to the Wildermann. The creature appeared, towering over Hans, and inspected the shoes with a critical eye. To everyone's surprise, the Wildermann nodded in approval.

""These shoes are well-crafted,"" he said. ""I will wear them, but only if you promise me something in return.""

""Anything, Wildermann,"" Hans replied, his heart pounding with anticipation.

""I will grant you one wish,"" the Wildermann said. ""But be careful what you ask for. The consequences can be dire.""

Hans thought long and hard about what he wanted. He wanted wealth, power, and fame, but he knew that these things would only bring him misery. Finally, he made his wish.

""I wish for the happiness and prosperity of my village, Schwarzwald,"" Hans said.

The Wildermann nodded and disappeared into the forest, leaving Hans with a sense of relief and satisfaction.

True to his word, the Wildermann protected Schwarzwald, ensuring that its people were safe and prosperous. The villagers lived in harmony, their lives enriched by the beauty of the forest and the kindness of their neighbor.

Years passed, and Hans grew old. He passed away peacefully, knowing that his wish had been granted. The villagers mourned his loss, but they also celebrated his life, remembering the humble shoemaker who had brought happiness and prosperity to their village.

And so, the story of Hans and the Wildermann became a legend, passed down from generation to generation. It served as a reminder that sometimes, the simplest wishes can bring the greatest happiness, and that the consequences of our actions can have far-reaching effects.

","In a small, secluded village nestled in the heart of the Black Forest, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. He was a simple man, content with his life, tending to the forest and caring for his beloved wife, Greta.

One day, as Hans was out in the forest, chopping wood, he heard a strange noise. It sounded like a baby crying, but he could not find the source. He searched high and low, but the sound seemed to be coming from deep within the forest, from a place he had never been before.

Intrigued, Hans decided to follow the sound, leaving his ax behind. As he ventured deeper into the forest, the sound grew louder, and he finally came upon a small, hidden clearing. There, under a large oak tree, he found a small, abandoned baby, wrapped in swaddling clothes and crying pitifully.

Hans' heart went out to the baby, and he knew he had to take it home to Greta. He carefully picked up the baby and began the long journey back to the village.

When they arrived, Greta was overjoyed to see the baby. She took it in her arms and immediately began to care for it, feeding it and rocking it to sleep. Hans and Greta named the baby Friedrich, and they raised him as their own.

As Friedrich grew, he showed a remarkable talent for woodcarving. He would spend hours in the forest, carving intricate figures and animals from the wood. His creations were so beautiful that the villagers would come from far and wide to see them.

One day, as Friedrich was carving a particularly detailed figure, he heard a voice. It was the voice of the baby he had found in the forest all those years ago.

""Friedrich,"" the voice said, ""I am the spirit of the forest. I have been watching over you, guiding you, and protecting you. I have given you your talent for woodcarving, and it is time for you to use it for a greater purpose.""

Friedrich was shocked and scared. He had never heard of a spirit of the forest before, and he didn't know what to make of it.

""What do you mean?"" he asked.

""I mean that the forest is in danger,"" the spirit said. ""A wicked witch has taken up residence in the heart of the forest, and she is using her dark magic to destroy the trees and the animals that live there. You must use your talent to create a magical charm that will drive her out and save the forest.""

Friedrich was determined to help. He spent days and nights working on the charm, carving it with all his skill and care. When it was finally finished, he took it to the heart of the forest and placed it at the witch's door.

As soon as the charm was in place, the witch's screams echoed through the forest. She tried to fight back, but the charm was too powerful. In the end, she was forced to flee, leaving the forest to heal and grow once more.

The villagers were overjoyed to see the forest return to its former glory, and they hailed Friedrich as a hero. From that day on, he was known as Friedrich the Woodcarver, and his creations were sought after by people from all over the land.

And so, Friedrich lived out the rest of his days in peace, surrounded by the beauty of the forest he had saved. And the spirit of the forest watched over him, always, forevermore.

The End.

This story is a traditional German folktale called ""Friedrich the Woodcarver."" It tells the story of a humble woodcutter who finds an abandoned baby in the forest and raises him as his own. As Friedrich grows, he discovers that he has a talent for woodcarving, and he is guided by the spirit of the forest to use his talent to save the forest from a wicked witch. The story ends with Friedrich becoming a hero and living out the rest of his days in peace."

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the trees stood tall and the air was thick with the scent of pine, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. He was a simple man, content with his life, and his only companions were the animals of the forest.

One day, as Hans was chopping wood near a crystal-clear stream, he heard a faint, melodious sound. He paused, listening intently. The sound grew louder, and he realized it was a voice, singing a hauntingly beautiful song.

Following the sound, Hans found a small, delicate girl standing on a moss-covered rock. She was no more than five years old, with long, golden hair and eyes as blue as the summer sky. She was dressed in a shimmering dress made of leaves and flowers, and a wreath of ivy adorned her head.

""Who are you?"" Hans asked, awestruck by her beauty.

""I am the Forest's Child,"" she replied, her voice as sweet as the song she had been singing. ""I have been lost, and I cannot find my way home.""

Hans offered to help the Forest's Child find her way, and she agreed. They walked for hours, the forest growing darker as the sun set. The Forest's Child seemed to know the way, but every time they came close to her home, they would be stopped by a mysterious barrier.

On the third day, they reached a large, ancient oak tree. The Forest's Child told Hans that beyond the tree lay her home, but a wicked witch had cast a spell, sealing the entrance with enchantments.

""I cannot pass,"" she said, tears welling up in her eyes. ""I have been lost for so long.""

Hans looked at the tree, and an idea formed in his mind. He took out his ax and began to chop at the tree's mighty trunk. For hours, he labored, his muscles aching, but he refused to give up.

Finally, with a mighty crash, the tree fell, revealing a hidden door. The Forest's Child gasped, her eyes wide with wonder. Hans helped her through the door, and they stepped into a beautiful glade, filled with the sweetest-smelling flowers Hans had ever smelled.

In the center of the glade stood a magnificent palace, made of crystal and gold. The Forest's Child ran towards it, her laughter ringing through the air. Hans followed, his heart filled with joy.

As they entered the palace, they were greeted by a kind old woman, who introduced herself as the Forest's Child's mother. She thanked Hans for his help, and the Forest's Child threw her arms around his neck, thanking him as well.

The old woman told Hans that he was welcome to stay and live in the palace, but he declined, saying he belonged in the forest. With a heavy heart, he said goodbye to the Forest's Child and her mother, promising to visit often.

As he walked back through the forest, Hans felt a sense of peace and contentment he had never known before. He knew he had done a good deed, and that the Forest's Child was safe and happy.

From that day on, Hans would often visit the glade, and the Forest's Child would come out to play with him. They would sing and laugh, and the forest seemed a little brighter, a little happier, because of their friendship.

And so, the story of the woodcutter and the Forest's Child became a legend in the Black Forest, a tale of friendship and bravery, of a simple man who helped a lost child find her way home. And the forest, with its towering trees and crystal-clear streams, would forever hold a special place in Hans' heart.

","In a small village nestled between the towering Black Forest, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. He was known for his strength, kindness, and unwavering honesty. One day, while he was out in the forest, chopping wood to support his family, he stumbled upon a peculiar stone.

The stone was unlike any he had ever seen. It was smooth, polished, and shimmered with an ethereal glow. Intrigued, Hans picked it up and placed it in his satchel. As he continued his work, he felt a strange warmth emanating from the stone.

Upon returning home, Hans' wife, Maria, noticed the change in her husband. He seemed more energetic, his eyes sparkled with a newfound vigor, and he spoke of grand ideas that seemed to come from nowhere. Maria, concerned, asked him about the source of this sudden transformation. Hans, with a smile, showed her the stone.

That night, as they lay in bed, the stone began to glow brighter. It filled their small home with a soft, warm light. Suddenly, a voice echoed through the room, ""I am the spirit of the forest, bound to this stone. I grant you three wishes, Hans. Use them wisely.""

Hans, startled, asked for nothing more than to provide for his family. The spirit granted his wish, and the next morning, their home was filled with gold and silver. Hans, feeling grateful, made his second wish for the health and happiness of his family. Again, the spirit granted his wish, and his family prospered.

With his final wish, Hans asked for wisdom. The spirit, pleased with his choices, granted his wish and disappeared, leaving the stone behind.

Hans and his family lived happily for many years, their wealth and health unmatched in the village. Hans used his newfound wisdom to help his neighbors, solving their problems and offering advice. He became a respected figure in the village, known for his kindness and wisdom.

However, as the years passed, Hans began to feel a growing emptiness. He had everything he had ever wanted, yet he felt a void within him. One day, he confided in his friend, the village blacksmith, about his feelings. The blacksmith, wise in his own right, suggested that Hans' heart yearned for something more than material wealth.

Hans, pondering the blacksmith's words, decided to use his final wish. He returned to the spot where he had found the stone, knelt down, and made his wish. ""I wish for the spirit of the forest to return and grant me a challenge, a task that will fill my heart with purpose.""

The spirit, appearing before him, was surprised by Hans' request. ""Are you certain, Hans? You have everything you could ever want. Why seek more?""

Hans, determined, replied, ""I have everything I need, but I yearn for something more. I wish to serve the village and the forest, to give back and make a difference.""

The spirit, touched by Hans' selflessness, granted his wish. ""I will give you a task, a challenge that will test your strength, wisdom, and courage. If you complete it, the forest and the village will forever remember your name.""

The task was to slay the fearsome Wild Hunt, a group of ghostly riders that terrorized the village every winter. Hans, undeterred, accepted the challenge.

As winter approached, the Wild Hunt began their nightly rampage. Hans prepared himself, using his wisdom to devise a plan. On the night of the full moon, he stood at the edge of the forest, his heart pounding with anticipation.

The Wild Hunt appeared, their ghostly horses galloping through the night. Hans, with a deep breath, charged towards them. He fought with all his might, using his strength and courage to fend off the ghostly riders.

The battle was long and fierce, but Hans refused to give up. He fought with a determination that surprised even himself. Finally, with a mighty swing of his axe, he struck down the leader of the Wild Hunt. The other ghostly riders, seeing their leader fall, disappeared into the night.

Hans returned to the village, hailed as a hero. The spirit of the forest, watching from afar, was moved by Hans' bravery and selflessness. ""You have completed your task, Hans. You have shown that wealth and power are not the only measures of a person's worth. You have a place in the hearts of the forest and the village.""

And so, Hans continued to live in the village, using his wisdom and strength to help his neighbors and protect the forest. He never sought more wealth or power, for he had found something far more valuable - purpose.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the tall pines whispered secrets to the wind, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. His life was simple, his days filled with the rhythm of the forest, the chop of his ax echoing through the trees.

One day, as Hans was cutting wood, he heard a faint melody, a hauntingly beautiful song that seemed to rise from the very earth. Intrigued, he followed the music, and as he ventured deeper into the forest, the song grew louder.

Suddenly, he came upon a small, hidden glade. In the center stood a tree unlike any other, its branches adorned with golden leaves that shimmered in the sunlight. Beneath the tree sat a woman of unearthly beauty, her voice like the sweetest of birdsong.

""Who are you?"" Hans asked, his heart pounding with a mixture of fear and awe.

""I am the Golden-Voiced Lady of the Forest,"" she replied, her eyes twinkling with amusement. ""And you are the first man to find me in a hundred years.""

""What do you want from me?"" Hans asked, his curiosity getting the better of him.

""I have been cursed to remain here, bound to this tree, until a man who truly loves me comes to free me,"" she said, her voice tinged with sadness. ""Will you be that man?""

Hans was taken aback. He had never felt such a powerful emotion before, but as he looked into the lady's eyes, he knew that he would do anything to help her.

""I will free you,"" he said, his voice steady and determined.

The lady smiled, her eyes shining with gratitude. ""Then you must return to your village and gather three things: a strand of my hair, a drop of my tears, and a lock of your own hair.""

Hans agreed, and with a final kiss on the lady's cheek, he left the glade, his heart heavy with the weight of his promise.

For days, Hans searched for a way to obtain the items the lady had requested. He returned to the glade several times, but each time, the lady was gone, leaving only a single golden leaf behind.

Finally, on the third day, as Hans was about to give up hope, he found the lady weeping beneath the tree. He gently took a strand of her hair and a tear that fell upon his hand.

""Now, I need a lock of your hair,"" the lady said, her voice trembling.

Hans hesitated, but he knew that he had to keep his promise. He took a small lock of his own hair and gave it to the lady.

With the three items in hand, Hans returned to the glade and placed them at the foot of the tree. The tree shimmered, and the lady was freed from her bonds.

""Thank you, Hans,"" she said, her eyes filled with tears. ""You have given me back my freedom, and for that, I will grant you three wishes.""

Hans was taken aback. He had never expected such a reward.

""I do not need anything for myself,"" he said, his voice filled with humility. ""But I have a friend who is very ill. I wish for him to be healed.""

The lady nodded, and with a wave of her hand, his friend was healed.

""What is your second wish?"" the lady asked.

""I wish for my village to prosper and for all its people to live in peace and harmony,"" Hans said.

The lady granted his wish, and the village flourished.

""And finally, what is your third wish?"" the lady asked.

Hans hesitated. He had never thought about what he truly wanted.

""I wish for the Golden-Voiced Lady to remain in our village, to sing her beautiful songs and bring joy to all who hear them,"" he said, his voice filled with emotion.

The lady smiled, her eyes shining with happiness. ""Your wishes are granted, Hans. You have been a true friend, and I will never forget you.""

With a final kiss, the lady disappeared, leaving behind only the golden leaves that shimmered in the sunlight. Hans returned to his village, his heart filled with joy and gratitude.

From that day on, the Golden-Voiced Lady could be heard singing her beautiful songs throughout the village, bringing joy to all who heard them. And Hans, though he never saw her again, knew that he had truly found something precious in the heart of the Black Forest.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the towering pines whispered secrets to the wind, lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. His life was simple, filled with the rhythm of the forest and the companionship of his faithful dog, Schnapps.

One day, as Hans was chopping wood near the edge of the forest, he heard a soft, melodious voice. He turned and saw a tiny woman, no larger than his hand, standing on a mushroom. She was exquisitely beautiful, with hair as golden as the sun and eyes as blue as the summer sky.

""Good day, kind sir,"" she said, her voice as sweet as the birdsong. ""I am the Queen of the Forest, and I have lost my golden comb. Could you help me find it?""

Hans was taken aback, but he agreed to help the queen. He promised to search the entire forest and return the comb by nightfall.

He and Schnapps set off, searching high and low. They climbed the tallest trees, crossed the widest streams, and delved into the deepest caves. But the comb remained elusive.

As the sun began to set, Hans was about to give up hope. But then, he heard a faint tinkling sound coming from a small clearing. There, nestled among the flowers, was the queen's golden comb.

Hans picked it up and returned to the queen. She was overjoyed and rewarded Hans with three wishes.

Hans thought long and hard about his wishes. He wished for a prosperous life, a loving family, and the ability to understand the language of animals.

The queen granted his wishes, and Hans returned home, his heart filled with joy. His life indeed became prosperous, and he married a kind and beautiful woman. Together, they had three children, and their home was always filled with laughter and love.

But the most remarkable thing was that Hans could now understand the language of animals. He learned so much from them, and his bond with Schnapps grew even stronger.

Years passed, and Hans grew old. But he never forgot the day he met the Queen of the Forest. He often told his grandchildren the story, and they listened, their eyes wide with wonder.

And so, the tale of Hans and the Queen of the Forest was passed down through generations, a testament to the magic that still lingered in the heart of the Black Forest.

The End.

Hans' life was filled with happiness and prosperity, all thanks to the Queen of the Forest and her golden comb. He lived a long and fulfilling life, his bond with Schnapps growing stronger with each passing day. His grandchildren grew up listening to the tale, their eyes wide with wonder. And as they grew older, they too learned to understand the language of animals, just like their grandfather. The magic of the Black Forest lived on, passed down from generation to generation, a reminder of the enchanting world that existed just beyond the edge of the forest. The End.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the trees stood tall and the air was thick with the scent of pine, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. Hans was a hardworking man, known far and wide for his strength and kindness. He lived in a small, cozy cottage with his wife, Maria, and their three children, Elisabeth, Friedrich, and little Hansel.

One day, as Hans was returning from the forest, he stumbled upon a strange, glowing object. It was a tiny, golden bird, no bigger than his thumb, with feathers that shimmered like the sun. The bird chirped softly, its eyes filled with a strange, otherworldly light. Hans, moved by its beauty, decided to take it home.

At home, Maria was delighted by the sight of the golden bird. She immediately made it a tiny bed of hay and fed it with the sweetest, ripest berries. The bird chirped happily, seeming to thrive under their care. However, as the days passed, the bird grew larger and larger, until it was the size of a normal bird.

One evening, as the family sat around the dinner table, the golden bird spoke for the first time. ""I am a magical bird,"" it said, its voice like the tinkling of bells. ""I have been sent to you as a gift, but in return, I need a favor. I need you to take me to the Witch in the Forest.""

Hans and Maria exchanged worried glances. They had heard tales of the Witch in the Forest, a cruel and wicked woman who demanded human sacrifices. But they had also heard that she was powerful, and perhaps she could help them.

The next day, Hans took the golden bird deep into the forest, following the bird's guidance. After what felt like hours of walking, they came to a clearing where a large, ominous house stood. Smoke billowed from its chimney, and the air was thick with an eerie silence.

Hans, trembling, approached the house and knocked on the door. The Witch answered, her face twisted into a hideous mask. She took one look at the golden bird and her eyes widened. ""You have brought me a gift,"" she hissed. ""I will grant you three wishes in return.""

Hans and Maria exchanged a hopeful glance. They had many wishes, but they knew they had to be careful. ""We wish for our children to be happy and healthy,"" Maria said, her voice trembling.

The Witch nodded, a cruel smile playing on her lips. ""I will grant your wish, but it will come at a price. Every year, on the night of the full moon, you must bring me a gift. If you fail, your children will fall ill.""

Hans and Maria agreed, relieved that their children would be happy and healthy. They returned home, the golden bird chirping happily in Hans's pocket.

For many years, Hans and Maria kept their promise, bringing the Witch gifts on the night of the full moon. Their children grew up to be healthy and happy, and the family lived in peace. But as the years passed, Hans and Maria grew older, and the burden of the Witch's demands became heavier.

One night, as Hans was preparing to leave for the Witch's house, he turned to Maria. ""I cannot do this anymore,"" he said, his voice filled with despair. ""I fear for our lives and the lives of our children.""

Maria nodded, tears in her eyes. ""We must find a way to break this curse,"" she said. ""I have an idea. Tomorrow, when you return from the forest, we will leave the house and never look back.""

The next day, as Hans returned from the forest, he found Maria and the children waiting for him. They had packed a few belongings and were ready to leave. Hans, his heart heavy, nodded. ""I will go and bring the Witch's gift,"" he said. ""Then we will leave.""

Hans approached the Witch's house, his heart pounding in his chest. He knocked on the door, and the Witch answered, her eyes narrowed. ""You have come to break your promise,"" she hissed.

Hans nodded. ""I cannot continue to live in fear,"" he said. ""I am breaking the curse.""

The Witch's eyes widened in fury. ""You fool!"" she screamed. ""You have broken the curse, but at a terrible cost. Your children will forget you, and you will be lost forever in the forest.""

Hans and his family left that night, never looking back. They wandered for many days, until they came to a small village. They settled there, and Hans worked hard to provide for his family.

Years passed, and Hans and Maria grew old. They never saw their children again, but they were content. They had each other, and they had lived a good life.

One night, as Hans lay in bed, he heard a soft chirping sound. He looked out the window, and there, perched on a branch, was the golden bird. It chirped softly, its eyes filled with a strange, otherworldly light.

Hans smiled, his heart filled with peace. He had broken the curse, and the golden bird was a reminder of the life he had once lived. He closed his eyes, content in the knowledge that he had done what was right.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, nestled between towering pines and ancient oaks, lay a quaint little village named Schwarzwald. The villagers lived in harmony with nature, their lives intertwined with the rhythm of the seasons. Among them was a humble cobbler named Hans.

Hans was known far and wide for his exquisite craftsmanship. His boots were not just footwear; they were works of art, each stitch a testament to his skill and dedication. But Hans had a secret longing. He yearned to create something truly extraordinary, a masterpiece that would echo through the ages.

One day, as Hans was returning from the market, he stumbled upon a peculiar stone. It was smooth, round, and shimmered with an otherworldly glow. Intrigued, Hans picked it up and felt an inexplicable connection. He took the stone home and placed it on his workbench, vowing to create something extraordinary with it.

Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months. Hans worked tirelessly, pouring his heart and soul into his creation. He crafted a boot unlike any other, adorning it with intricate patterns and magical runes. As he finished the final stitch, he felt a surge of energy coursing through him. The stone glowed brighter, and the boot seemed to come alive.

Word of Hans' creation spread throughout Schwarzwald. Villagers flocked to his shop, eager to witness the marvel. As they gazed upon the boot, they felt a strange sense of awe and wonder. Some said it was a gift from the gods, others claimed it was a curse. But all agreed that it was a sight to behold.

One day, a stranger arrived in Schwarzwald. He was tall, with piercing blue eyes and a mysterious air about him. He introduced himself as the Duke of Bavaria, and he had heard tales of Hans' extraordinary boot. Intrigued, the Duke requested to see it.

Hans, proud of his creation, eagerly showed the Duke the boot. The Duke examined it closely, his eyes gleaming with interest. He then made an offer that Hans could not refuse - to become the royal cobbler of Bavaria, crafting boots for the Duke and his court.

Hans was torn. He longed for the recognition and wealth that the offer promised, but he feared losing the simple life he cherished in Schwarzwald. After much deliberation, he decided to accept the offer. He bid farewell to his friends and family, taking the magical boot with him.

Life in Bavaria was grand. Hans was showered with praise and riches. But he missed Schwarzwald, the quiet village where he had found his calling. He longed for the sound of the wind rustling through the trees, the laughter of children playing, and the warm embrace of his community.

One day, as Hans was crafting a boot for the Duke, he felt a familiar energy coursing through him. The magical stone glowed, and the boot seemed to come alive. Hans looked up, startled, as he saw the image of a villager from Schwarzwald reflected in the polished leather.

The villager was his friend, Karl, who had been searching for Hans, desperate to bring him back home. Hans was overcome with emotion. He realized that the magical boot had been a gift from the gods, not to bring him wealth and fame, but to remind him of his roots and the people he loved.

Hans made a decision. He would return to Schwarzwald, leaving behind the riches and the glamour of the court. He took the magical boot with him, knowing that it would always be a reminder of the extraordinary journey he had embarked upon.

As Hans stepped off the carriage in Schwarzwald, he was greeted with open arms. The villagers welcomed him back, their faces lit up with joy. Hans felt a sense of peace and contentment he had not felt in years. He returned to his humble cobbler's shop, his heart filled with gratitude for the magical boot that had led him home.

And so, Hans continued to craft his boots, each stitch a testament to his love for Schwarzwald. The magical boot was displayed in his shop, a reminder of the extraordinary journey he had taken. And though it brought him no wealth or fame, it brought him something far more precious - a life filled with love, community, and the simple pleasures of the Black Forest.

","In a small village nestled between the rolling hills of Bavaria, there lived a humble blacksmith named Hans. He was known far and wide for his craftsmanship, but he was also known for his kindness and generosity.

One day, as Hans was working in his forge, a stranger appeared at his door. The stranger was tall and gaunt, with a long, flowing beard and piercing eyes. He introduced himself as the Devil, and he had come to make a deal with Hans.

""I have heard of your skill as a blacksmith,"" the Devil said, ""and I would like to offer you a deal. In exchange for your soul, I will give you the power to create the most beautiful and powerful weapons the world has ever seen. You will be rich beyond your wildest dreams, and your name will be remembered for all time.""

Hans was taken aback. He had heard tales of the Devil's deals, and he knew that they always came with a price. But he also knew that his skills as a blacksmith could help his village, and he couldn't bear the thought of turning down such an offer.

""I will think on it,"" Hans said, ""but I must speak with my wife first.""

The Devil nodded, and he waited outside while Hans went to speak with his wife, Maria.

Maria listened as Hans told her of the Devil's offer. She was frightened, but she also knew that Hans had a gift for his craft, and she wanted to see him succeed.

""What do you think we should do?"" Hans asked.

""I believe we should accept the Devil's offer,"" Maria said, ""but only if you promise me one thing. You must always use your powers for good, and never let them corrupt your soul.""

Hans agreed, and he went back to the Devil to accept his offer.

For a time, Hans's weapons were indeed the most beautiful and powerful in the world. The villagers were amazed by his work, and he became rich and famous. But as the years passed, Hans began to notice a change in himself. He found himself growing more and more impatient, and he began to lose his kindness and generosity.

One day, a group of bandits attacked the village, and Hans's weapons were no match for them. The villagers were terrified, and they turned to Hans for help.

But Hans was no longer the humble blacksmith they had once known. He was now a proud and arrogant man, and he refused to help them.

""I have more important things to do than to help a bunch of peasants,"" Hans said, ""I have my own interests to consider now.""

The villagers were devastated, and they turned to the Devil for help.

""I warned you not to let your powers corrupt your soul,"" the Devil said, ""but you did not listen. Now you must suffer the consequences.""

With a wave of his hand, the Devil took away Hans's powers, and he left the village in ruins.

Hans was filled with regret, and he realized that he had made a terrible mistake. He went to Maria and begged for her forgiveness, and she took him back.

Together, they rebuilt the village, and Hans vowed to use his skills for good once again. He never again made a deal with the Devil, and he lived out the rest of his days in peace.

And so the story of Hans the blacksmith is remembered to this day, as a cautionary tale of the dangers of pride and greed.

The End.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the trees stood tall and the air was thick with the scent of pine, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. He was a man of simple pleasures, content with his life of solitude and the rhythm of the forest.

One day, as Hans was chopping wood near a crystal-clear stream, he heard a faint, melodious sound. It was a voice, singing a hauntingly beautiful song. He followed the sound and found a tiny, shimmering bird with feathers as blue as the midday sky. The bird was trapped in a thorny bush, unable to free itself.

Hans carefully approached the bird, his heart filled with compassion. He gently untangled the bird from the thorns and set it free. The bird, grateful for Hans' help, sang a final, beautiful note before flying away.

From that day forward, the bird returned every day to sing for Hans. The two became inseparable friends, and the forest seemed a little brighter with the bird's music.

One winter, a terrible storm swept through the Black Forest. The wind howled, the trees groaned, and the snow fell relentlessly. Hans was out in the storm, trying to protect his home from the onslaught.

As the storm raged on, Hans began to tire. He stumbled back to his cabin, cold and weary. He found the door locked, and he had no key. He pounded on the door, calling out for help, but there was no answer.

In the distance, he heard the sound of the shimmering bird. It was singing a song of warmth and comfort. Hans followed the sound, and as he approached his cabin, he saw the bird perched on the windowsill. The bird began to sing a new song, a song of protection and strength.

As the bird sang, the storm seemed to abate. The wind quieted, the snow slowed, and the temperature rose. Hans watched in amazement as the bird finished its song and flew away.

He rushed to the door, and to his relief, it opened. Inside, his cabin was warm and cozy, untouched by the storm. Hans was safe.

From that day forward, Hans knew that the shimmering bird was no ordinary bird. It was a magical creature, sent to protect him. He lived out his days in the Black Forest, his friendship with the bird a constant source of joy and wonder.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the trees stood tall and the air was thick with the scent of pine, there was a quaint little village called Schwarzwald. The villagers were simple folk, living off the land and each other, and they had a peculiar tradition. Every year, on the eve of St. John's Day, they would gather in the town square to tell the tale of the Forest Spirit.

The Forest Spirit, or Waldgeist, was a creature of great power and mystery. It was said to have lived in the heart of the forest for as long as anyone could remember. Some claimed to have seen it, a shimmering figure that danced among the trees, while others swore it was nothing more than a figment of their imagination.

One year, as the villagers gathered in the town square, the air was thick with anticipation. The sky was a deep shade of blue, and the sun was setting, casting long shadows across the cobblestone streets. The village elder, a wise old man named Hans, stood before the crowd, his eyes twinkling with the fire of the stories he was about to tell.

""Children and friends,"" he began, ""I have a tale to tell you tonight, a tale that has been passed down from generation to generation. A tale of the Forest Spirit, the Waldgeist.""

The crowd hushed, their eyes wide with excitement. Hans cleared his throat and began to speak.

""Long, long ago, in a time before memory, there was a young girl named Elise. She was the most beautiful girl in the village, with hair the color of gold and eyes as blue as the summer sky. But Elise was not content with her life in the village. She yearned for adventure, for something more than the simple life she led.

One day, as she was wandering in the forest, she stumbled upon a clearing. In the center of the clearing stood a tree unlike any other, its branches reaching up to the heavens. As she approached the tree, she felt a strange sensation, as if the air around her was alive.

Suddenly, the branches of the tree began to move, and a figure emerged. It was the Forest Spirit, the Waldgeist. Elise was terrified, but the Waldgeist spoke to her in a voice that was both soft and commanding.

'You have come to me, Elise,' it said. 'I have been waiting for someone like you. I have a quest for you, a quest that will change the world.'

Elise was hesitant, but the Waldgeist's words filled her with a sense of purpose. She agreed to the quest, and the Waldgeist gave her a small, glowing stone.

'This is the Stone of the Forest,' it said. 'It will guide you on your journey and protect you from harm. But beware, for the path you are about to embark on is fraught with danger.'

Elise thanked the Waldgeist and set off on her journey. She traveled far and wide, facing countless challenges and overcoming insurmountable odds. She battled monsters and tamed beasts, and she learned many secrets of the world.

But the journey was not without its cost. Elise's heart grew heavy with the weight of the world, and she began to doubt herself. She questioned whether she was truly meant to be the one to complete the quest.

One day, as she was wandering through a dense forest, she came upon a clearing. In the center of the clearing stood a tree, just like the one she had first encountered in the Black Forest. And there, standing before the tree, was the Forest Spirit, the Waldgeist.

'Elise,' it said, 'you have come a long way. You have faced many challenges and learned many things. But the quest is not yet complete. You must return to the Black Forest and use the Stone of the Forest to heal the land.'

Elise was filled with determination. She knew what she had to do. She returned to the Black Forest and, with the help of the Stone of the Forest, she healed the land. The forests grew lush and green, and the animals flourished.

But the quest had taken its toll on Elise. She was exhausted, both physically and emotionally. She lay down to rest, and as she closed her eyes, she felt a sense of peace wash over her.

'Elise,' the Waldgeist said, 'you have completed your quest. You have healed the land, and for that, you will be rewarded. You will live out the rest of your days in peace and happiness.'

And so, Elise lived out the rest of her days in the Black Forest, surrounded by the beauty of nature and the love of the villagers. She was hailed as a hero, and her story was passed down from generation to generation.

And that, my friends, is the tale of the Forest Spirit, the Waldgeist. A tale of adventure, of courage, and of the power of the human spirit. The End.""

The crowd erupted into applause, their hearts filled with the wonder of the story. As they dispersed, they knew that they had been a part of something special, something that connected them to the history of their village. And as they went home, they whispered the tale of Elise and the Forest Spirit to their children, keeping the tradition alive for another year."

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the towering pines whispered ancient secrets, and the moss-covered stones bore the weight of countless years, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. His life was simple, filled with the rhythm of the forest, the crackle of the fire, and the gentle hoot of the owls at night.

One day, as Hans was sawing wood, a tiny, golden bird perched on a nearby branch. Its feathers shimmered like the sun, and its eyes sparkled with an intelligence that belied its size. ""Greetings, Hans,"" it chirped, its voice as melodious as the wind through the trees.

Hans, startled, looked up from his work. ""Who are you?"" he asked, his heart pounding in his chest.

""I am the Gold-Speckled Meadowlark,"" the bird replied. ""I have been sent to grant you three wishes. But beware, for each wish comes with a price.""

Hans, his mind racing, thought of the things he could wish for. A life free of hardship, a house filled with gold, a heart filled with love. But as he pondered, he realized that he was content with his life. He had everything he needed, and he did not wish to pay the price for unneeded desires.

""I do not wish for riches, nor for love,"" Hans said, his voice steady. ""I wish for wisdom, so that I may better understand the world and the people in it.""

The Gold-Speckled Meadowlark nodded. ""Your wish is granted. But remember, with wisdom comes responsibility.""

With his newfound wisdom, Hans' life changed. He could see the world in a way he never could before, understanding the thoughts and feelings of those around him. He became a respected elder, his advice sought by all.

Years passed, and Hans grew old. His body weakened, and his steps slowed, but his mind remained sharp. One day, as he sat by the fire, he heard a knock at his door. It was the Gold-Speckled Meadowlark.

""You have used your wisdom well, Hans,"" the bird said. ""But now it is time for your third wish.""

Hans looked at the bird, his heart heavy. He had lived a good life, but he knew that his time was drawing to a close. ""I do not wish for anything,"" he said. ""I have lived a long and happy life, and I am content.""

The Gold-Speckled Meadowlark looked at him with sad eyes. ""Very well,"" it said. ""But remember, even without a wish, there is still a price to pay.""

With that, the bird flew away, and Hans was left alone. He continued to live out his days in peace, his wisdom guiding him, until one day, he closed his eyes for the last time.

The villagers mourned his loss, but they knew that Hans had lived a good life. And as they gathered around his grave, they whispered the story of the Gold-Speckled Meadowlark, and the price that had been paid for wisdom.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the trees stood tall and proud, and the wind whispered ancient secrets, there was a quaint little village called Schwarzwald. The villagers were simple folk, living off the land and each other, their lives dictated by the rhythm of the seasons.

In this village, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. He was a man of few words, but his strength and kindness were legendary. He lived alone in a small cottage, nestled between the trees, with his only companion being his loyal dog, Max.

One day, as Hans was out in the forest, chopping wood, he heard a strange sound. It was a soft, melodious hum, unlike anything he had ever heard before. Following the sound, he found a tiny, shimmering bird with feathers of gold and silver. The bird was trapped in a thorny bush, its wings torn and bleeding.

Hans carefully freed the bird, cradling it in his hands. The bird looked up at him with eyes that seemed to hold a thousand stories. It spoke, its voice as sweet as the song it had been singing. ""I am the Golden Nightingale,"" it said. ""You have saved my life. In return, I shall grant you three wishes.""

Hans was taken aback. He had never heard of such a creature, let alone one that granted wishes. He thanked the bird and told it that he did not need any wishes. The bird insisted, and after much persuasion, Hans made his first wish. ""I wish for a bountiful harvest every year,"" he said.

The bird nodded and granted his wish. True to its word, the following year, Schwarzwald was blessed with an abundance of crops, enough to feed the village for years to come. The villagers were overjoyed and thanked Hans for his good fortune.

With his second wish, Hans asked for the health and happiness of his fellow villagers. The bird granted his wish, and from that day forward, the villagers of Schwarzwald lived in peace and prosperity.

Now, Hans was a simple man, and he had no desire for material wealth. He had all he needed in his small cottage and the company of Max. So, he saved his third wish for something truly special. ""I wish for a companion,"" he said. ""Someone to share my life with.""

The Golden Nightingale looked at him with a sad smile. ""I cannot grant that wish,"" it said. ""For I am bound by my nature to wander the forests, singing my songs. But I shall give you a gift that will bring you a companion.""

The bird sang a beautiful, haunting melody, and as it finished, a tiny, golden acorn fell from the sky and landed in Hans's outstretched hand. ""Plant this acorn, and a tree will grow,"" the bird said. ""From that tree, a beautiful maiden will bloom. She will be your companion, your love.""

Hans thanked the bird and returned to his cottage. He planted the golden acorn in his garden, and as the seasons passed, it grew into a magnificent tree. One day, a beautiful maiden emerged from the tree, her hair as golden as the acorn, her eyes as blue as the sky.

Her name was Elise, and she was the most beautiful woman Hans had ever seen. They fell in love at first sight, and Hans knew that he had been granted the greatest gift of all. They lived happily ever after, their love as strong and pure as the Golden Nightingale's song.

And so, the story of Hans and Elise became a legend in Schwarzwald. Their love story was told and retold, their names sung by the Golden Nightingale itself. And whenever a villager needed a reminder of true love, they would look to the golden tree, where Hans and Elise had found each other.

","Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between the Black Forest and the Rhine River, there lived a humble miller named Hans. He was a kind and hardworking man, known for his strong arms and sturdy legs, which turned the millstones day and night.

One day, as Hans was grinding the grain, he heard a faint voice whispering from the wind. ""Miller Hans, I have a task for you. Retrieve the golden goose from the witch in the forest, and in return, I shall grant you three wishes.""

Hans, startled by the voice, nearly dropped the sack of flour. He looked around, but there was no one in sight. He shrugged it off as his imagination playing tricks on him and continued his work.

Days turned into weeks, and the voice returned, reminding Hans of his task. Reluctantly, he decided to venture into the forest to find the witch and the golden goose.

Armed with nothing but his courage and a loaf of bread, Hans set off into the dense forest. He walked for hours, the trees growing darker and more menacing with each step. Suddenly, he heard a loud cackle, and there, in a clearing, stood the witch, her long, warty nose twitching.

""Ah, Miller Hans, you've come to claim your prize,"" the witch sneered. ""But be warned, the golden goose is no ordinary bird. She lays a single golden egg each day, but if you try to take it, she will lay a golden brick instead.""

Hans nodded, understanding the challenge ahead. He approached the golden goose, who preened her feathers and laid a golden egg without a fuss. Hans reached for it, but the goose let out a screech, and the egg turned into a brick.

Disappointed but determined, Hans returned to the witch the next day. Again, the goose laid a golden egg, and again, Hans tried to take it. Again, the goose screeched, and the egg turned into a brick.

This continued for a week, with Hans trying and failing to take the golden egg. On the seventh day, as he approached the goose, she looked at him with sad eyes. Hans felt a pang of sympathy and decided to leave the golden egg alone.

The witch, seeing Hans' change of heart, granted him his three wishes. Hans wished for the health and happiness of his family, the prosperity of his mill, and the safety of his village. The witch nodded, and with a wave of her hand, his wishes were granted.

Hans returned to his village, his heart full of gratitude. He worked harder than ever, ensuring his mill flourished, and he shared his wealth with the villagers. His family lived happily, and the village thrived.

And so, the story of Miller Hans and the golden goose became a legend, a tale of kindness and wisdom. Hans never spoke of his encounter with the witch or his three wishes, but the villagers knew that their miller was blessed, and they lived in peace and prosperity.

The End.

","In a quaint village nestled amidst the verdant hills of the Black Forest, there lived a humble cobbler named Hans. His shop, a small, rustic building with a thatched roof, was filled with the aroma of fresh leather and polished wood.

Hans was a kind-hearted man, loved by all in the village. However, he was also known for his peculiar habit. Every night, he would venture into the forest, returning only at dawn. The villagers, though curious, never asked about his nightly excursions.

One day, a young girl named Greta, who had recently moved to the village, asked her mother about Hans' nightly trips. Her mother, not wanting to pry, simply smiled and said, ""That's just Hans, dear. He has his reasons.""

Intrigued, Greta decided to follow Hans one night. As twilight fell, she hid behind a large oak tree, watching as Hans stepped into the forest, a lantern in his hand. The forest was eerily silent, save for the occasional hoot of an owl.

Greta followed at a distance, her heart pounding in her chest. She watched as Hans stopped at a large, ancient oak tree, its branches twisted and gnarled. He spoke to the tree in a language Greta didn't understand, then placed a small, intricately carved wooden box at its base.

Suddenly, the tree began to glow, and a beautiful, ethereal woman stepped out. She was taller than any woman Greta had ever seen, with long, flowing hair the color of moonlight. Her eyes were as deep and mysterious as the night sky.

""Who are you?"" Greta asked, her voice barely a whisper.

The woman turned to Greta, her eyes filled with surprise. ""I am the Forest Queen,"" she said. ""And you are the first human who has ever seen me.""

Greta was speechless. The Forest Queen smiled and explained that Hans had been bringing her gifts - a small wooden box each night - in exchange for her protection over the village.

""But why does he do this?"" Greta asked.

The Forest Queen sighed. ""Long ago, Hans made a promise to me. In return for my protection, he vowed to never marry or have children. He has kept his promise, but now, he is growing old. I cannot break his promise, but I can grant him a wish.""

Greta thought for a moment. ""He should be able to marry and have children,"" she said. ""He deserves happiness.""

The Forest Queen nodded. ""Very well. From now on, Hans will be free to marry and have children. But remember, this wish comes with a condition. The first child born to Hans must return to me on their 16th birthday.""

Greta agreed, and the Forest Queen disappeared back into the tree. Hans, who had been watching the whole time, approached Greta.

""You have seen my secret,"" he said. ""I am grateful. From now on, you are like family to me.""

And so, Greta became a part of Hans' life. Years passed, and Greta grew into a beautiful woman. Hans, too, grew old, but he was happy.

On the day Greta's first child, a beautiful girl named Elise, turned 16, Hans and Greta prepared for the inevitable. With a heavy heart, Hans took Elise to the ancient oak tree.

""My dear child,"" he said, ""I have kept a promise to the Forest Queen. You must go with her.""

Elise looked at her father, her eyes filled with tears. ""Father,"" she said, ""I don't want to go.""

Hans smiled, his eyes filled with love. ""I know, my dear. But it is a promise I made long ago. I will miss you, but I am proud of you. Remember, you are the first of many, and our family will continue.""

With a final hug, Elise stepped into the tree. The Forest Queen appeared, and together, they disappeared. Hans and Greta were left standing in the forest, their hearts heavy but filled with peace.

""We have done what was right,"" Greta said, her voice barely a whisper.

Hans nodded. ""Yes, my love. We have.""

And so, the story of Hans and the Forest Queen became a legend in the village. Every year, on Elise's birthday, the villagers would gather at the ancient oak tree, remembering the sacrifice made by a humble cobbler and his family.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the towering pines whispered secrets to the wind, lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. His life was simple, filled with the rhythm of the forest and the solace of his solitude. One day, as he was chopping wood near the edge of the forest, he heard a faint melody that seemed to float on the breeze.

Intrigued, Hans followed the music, and as he ventured deeper into the forest, the melody grew louder. He came upon a clearing where a beautiful maiden stood, her hair as golden as the sun, her eyes as blue as the summer sky, and her voice as sweet as the forest's own song. She was singing a hauntingly beautiful song, and as she sang, she weaved a spellbinding web of enchantment around Hans.

""Who are you?"" Hans asked, his voice barely a whisper.

""I am the Forest's Daughter,"" she replied, her eyes never leaving his. ""I have been waiting for someone worthy to break my enchantment. Will you be that someone?""

Hans was taken aback. He had never imagined such a thing was possible. But he felt a pull, a yearning, that he could not ignore. ""I will try,"" he said, his heart pounding in his chest.

The Forest's Daughter smiled, her eyes twinkling with delight. ""Then come with me, Hans. I will give you three tasks to complete. If you succeed, I will be yours, and you will be the ruler of the Black Forest.""

Hans agreed, and the Forest's Daughter led him to a nearby stream. ""In this stream, there is a golden apple. Retrieve it for me.""

Hans waded into the cold water, the pebbles beneath his feet sharp and uncomfortable. He searched the bottom of the stream, his hands brushing against the smooth stones. After what felt like an eternity, he finally felt something different. He reached down and pulled out a golden apple, its surface gleaming in the sunlight.

""Well done, Hans,"" the Forest's Daughter said, her voice filled with admiration. ""Now, I need you to slay the fearsome wolf that haunts these woods. He has been terrorizing the villagers, and I need you to put an end to his reign of terror.""

Hans nodded, determination burning in his eyes. He ventured deeper into the forest, his heart pounding with fear and anticipation. He knew the wolf was a formidable foe, but he also knew that he had to succeed. He found the wolf's den, its entrance guarded by a fearsome creature with eyes that burned like embers and teeth that could cleave a tree in two.

Hans drew his axe, his hands trembling. He charged at the wolf, his heart pounding in his ears. They fought, their clash echoing through the forest, a symphony of fury and determination. Hans was battered and bruised, but he refused to give up. With a final, desperate swing, he struck the wolf, his axe sinking deep into its heart. The wolf howled in pain, its body convulsing, and then it was still.

""You have done well, Hans,"" the Forest's Daughter said, her voice filled with pride. ""Now, there is one more task. I am trapped in this enchanted forest, and I need you to find the key to my freedom.""

Hans searched the forest, his eyes scanning every tree, every stone. He found nothing. He was about to give up when he noticed a small, unassuming mushroom growing at the base of an ancient oak. He picked it up, and as he did, he felt a surge of energy coursing through his veins.

He returned to the Forest's Daughter, the mushroom in his hand. ""This is the key,"" he said, his voice filled with hope.

The Forest's Daughter took the mushroom, her eyes shining with gratitude. ""Thank you, Hans. You have proven yourself worthy. From this day forward, you will be the ruler of the Black Forest, and I will be your wife.""

Hans and the Forest's Daughter were married in a ceremony beneath the towering pines. The forest came alive with the sounds of laughter and music, and Hans knew that he had found his true home.

And so, Hans ruled the Black Forest with wisdom and kindness, and the Forest's Daughter by his side, they lived happily ever after. The End."

","Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between the rolling hills of Bavaria, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. He was a hardworking man, known for his strength and kindness. His only companion was a talking raven named Rudi, who had been his friend since childhood.

One day, as Hans was returning from the forest, Rudi perched on his shoulder and said, ""Hans, I have seen something strange in the forest. A beautiful golden apple tree, its fruits shining brighter than the sun. But beware, Hans, for I saw a fearsome dragon guarding it.""

Hans, intrigued by the golden apples, decided to venture into the forest the next day. He armed himself with his axe and set off, Rudi flying overhead to guide him.

As they approached the tree, they saw the dragon, its scales glistening in the sun. The dragon, seeing Hans, roared, ""Who dares to approach my golden apples? I will not let anyone take them!""

Hans, undeterred, replied, ""I only seek one apple for my old mother. She has been ill and I believe these golden apples will cure her.""

The dragon, moved by Hans' kindness, agreed to let him have one apple. But on one condition: Hans had to promise to return the apple if it did not cure his mother. Hans agreed and took an apple.

Hans rushed home and gave the apple to his mother. To their amazement, she recovered instantly. The golden apple was indeed a miracle fruit.

True to his word, Hans returned to the dragon and gave back the apple. The dragon, pleased with Hans' honesty, gave him three more apples, saying, ""Take these for your family and friends. They will bring happiness and good fortune.""

Hans returned home, sharing the apples with everyone in the village. As promised, the apples brought happiness and good fortune. The villagers lived in peace and prosperity, and Hans became a hero.

And so, the story of Hans and the golden apples became a legend in the village. Every year, on the anniversary of the day Hans found the golden apple tree, the villagers would celebrate with a grand feast, sharing the apples that still grew there.

The End.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the towering pines whispered secrets to the wind, and the rivers danced with the rhythm of the earth, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. His life was simple, and he was content with his solitary existence, cutting wood and tending to his small cottage.

One day, as Hans was wandering through the forest, he stumbled upon a peculiar sight. A tiny, golden bird, no larger than his thumb, was trapped in a thorny bush. Hans carefully freed the bird, and to his surprise, it spoke to him.

""Thank you, kind woodcutter,"" the bird chirped. ""I am the Golden Sparrow, and I am in your debt. I have a favor to ask of you. Deep within the forest, there is a hidden treasure guarded by a fearsome dragon. I need you to retrieve it for me.""

Hans was taken aback. ""A dragon? I don't think I'm the right person for this task.""

""Nonsense,"" the bird replied. ""I have seen your strength and courage. You are the one I need.""

Reluctantly, Hans agreed. The Golden Sparrow led him to a cave, guarded by a massive, fire-breathing dragon. Hans' heart pounded in his chest as he approached the cave, but he steeled himself and entered.

Inside, he found a vast chamber filled with gold and jewels. At the far end, the dragon lay coiled around a glittering chest. Hans approached slowly, trying not to draw the dragon's attention.

As he reached for the chest, the dragon stirred. Its eyes glowed red, and it roared, filling the chamber with heat and smoke. Hans stood his ground, his resolve hardening.

""You dare to take what is mine?"" the dragon hissed.

""I am not here for your treasure,"" Hans said, his voice steady. ""I am here for the Golden Sparrow's request.""

The dragon snorted, its eyes narrowing. ""And who are you to defy me?""

""I am a woodcutter, nothing more,"" Hans replied. ""But I am also a man of honor, and I will not abandon a friend in need.""

The dragon was silent for a moment, then it sighed. ""Very well,"" it said. ""Take the treasure, but beware. It is cursed. Whoever possesses it will be plagued by misfortune until they return it to its rightful place.""

Hans nodded, taking the chest and making his way back to the entrance of the cave. As he emerged into the fresh air, he felt a weight on his shoulders, as if the curse had already begun to take hold.

He returned to the Golden Sparrow, who took the chest and flew away, leaving Hans alone in the forest. Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, and Hans' life became a series of misfortunes. His crops failed, his tools broke, and his health declined.

One day, as he lay in his cottage, too weak to move, he heard a soft chirp. He looked up to see the Golden Sparrow perched on his window sill.

""I have returned the treasure,"" the bird said. ""Your misfortunes are over.""

Hans felt a wave of relief wash over him. ""Thank you, Golden Sparrow,"" he said. ""I am truly grateful.""

""It was my pleasure,"" the bird replied. ""But remember, always be careful what you wish for, for it may bring more trouble than you bargained for.""

And with that, the Golden Sparrow flew away, leaving Hans to ponder the lesson he had learned. From that day forward, he lived a simple, contented life, free from the curse of the hidden treasure.

The End."

","In a quaint village nestled in the heart of the Black Forest, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. His life was simple, his days filled with the rhythm of the forest. But Hans was not like the other villagers. He had a secret, a gift that set him apart.

One day, while he was out in the forest, cutting wood, he stumbled upon a tiny, shimmering object. It was a golden ball, no larger than his fist. As he picked it up, he felt a strange warmth radiating from it. Suddenly, the ball spoke, ""I am the Golden Ball of the Black Forest. I grant three wishes to whoever finds me.""

Hans was taken aback. He had heard tales of magical objects, but he never thought he would find one. He thought for a moment, then said, ""I wish for a beautiful home, larger and more comfortable than any in the village."" With a flash of light, his small, dilapidated hut was replaced by a grand house, its walls made of the finest oak, its roof of the most beautiful slate.

The villagers were amazed. They had never seen such a house in their village. Hans, however, was troubled. He had used his first wish, and he had nothing left for himself. He thought long and hard, then said, ""I wish for a beautiful wife, kind and loving."" Once again, the ball flashed, and a woman as beautiful as the sun appeared before him. Her name was Greta, and she was kind and loving, just as Hans had wished.

Hans was happy, but he still felt something was missing. He thought about his wish, and then said, ""I wish for a child, a son who will be wise and strong."" The ball flashed once more, and a baby boy was placed in Greta's arms. They named him Friedrich, and he grew to be just as Hans had wished.

Years passed, and Friedrich grew into a strong, wise young man. He was loved by all in the village, and he was especially close to his father. One day, Friedrich came to Hans with a troubled look on his face. ""Father,"" he said, ""I have heard whispers of a wicked witch who lives deep in the forest. She is said to be powerful and cruel, and she demands a sacrifice from the villagers every year.""

Hans knew of the witch. He had heard the same stories, but he had never given them much thought. Friedrich, however, was determined to put an end to the witch's cruelty. ""I will go to the witch and confront her,"" he said. Hans tried to dissuade him, but Friedrich was resolute.

The next day, Friedrich set out into the forest, armed with nothing but his courage. He followed the path deep into the heart of the forest, until he came to a clearing where the witch's hut stood. He could see the witch inside, a twisted, ugly figure with long, sharp nails and a cackling laugh.

Friedrich steeled himself and marched into the hut. The witch looked up, her eyes narrowing in anger. ""Who dares to disturb me?"" she hissed. Friedrich stood tall, his voice steady. ""I am Friedrich, son of Hans, and I have come to put an end to your cruelty.""

The witch laughed, a cold, harsh sound that sent shivers down Friedrich's spine. ""You think you can defeat me?"" she sneered. ""I am the most powerful witch in the Black Forest. No one can stand against me.""

Friedrich, however, was not intimidated. He had been raised with wisdom and strength, and he knew he could not be defeated. He drew his sword and charged at the witch. They fought for what seemed like hours, their blades clashing again and again.

Finally, Friedrich landed a blow that sent the witch reeling. She stumbled back, her eyes wide with surprise and fear. Friedrich stood over her, his sword at her throat. ""I am the son of a man who was granted three wishes by a magical ball,"" he said, ""and I have come to claim my final wish. I wish for the end of your cruelty, and for the happiness of my village.""

With a final, desperate scream, the witch vanished, leaving Friedrich standing alone in the clearing. He sheathed his sword and turned to leave, but as he did, he noticed something glinting in the grass. It was the Golden Ball of the Black Forest.

Friedrich picked up the ball and looked at it. He thought for a moment, then said, ""I wish for the happiness and prosperity of my village, and for the safety of all who live here."" The ball flashed once more, and a sense of peace and contentment settled over the village.

Friedrich returned home, where he was greeted with cheers and laughter. His father, Hans, was overjoyed. ""You have done a great thing, my son,"" he said, ""you have saved our village from a wicked witch.""

Friedrich smiled, a sense of pride and satisfaction filling him. He had used his final wish wisely, and he knew that his village would be safe and happy for generations to come. And so, the story of Friedrich, the son of Hans, became a legend in the Black Forest, a tale of courage, wisdom, and the power of a single wish. The End."

","In the heart of the Black Forest, nestled between towering pine trees and hidden by a veil of mist, lay the quaint village of Schwarzwald. The villagers lived in harmony with nature, their lives governed by the rhythm of the seasons and the whims of the forest. Among them was a humble woodcutter named Hans, who was known for his strength and kindness.

One day, as Hans was returning from the forest, he stumbled upon a tiny, shivering figure huddled beneath a bush. To his surprise, it was a small, golden-haired girl. She looked no older than five, yet she spoke with the wisdom of an old sage.

""Greetings, Hans,"" she said, her voice as clear as a bell. ""I am the Spirit of the Forest, and I have been trapped in this form by an evil sorcerer. He has hidden me deep within the forest, and I cannot return to my true form until I find the Three Enchanted Stones.""

Hans was taken aback. ""But how can I help you, little one?"" he asked.

The Spirit of the Forest smiled. ""You have a pure heart, Hans. I believe you are the one who can find the stones and free me from this curse.""

With a heavy heart, Hans agreed to help. The Spirit of the Forest gave him a small, glowing map and sent him on his way.

For days, Hans journeyed through the forest, following the map's directions. He encountered many challenges, from raging rivers to treacherous mountains, but his determination never wavered.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Hans arrived at the foot of a towering mountain. The map indicated that the first stone was hidden within its caverns. With a deep breath, Hans began his ascent.

The climb was arduous, but Hans pressed on, driven by his desire to help the Spirit of the Forest. After what felt like hours, he reached the top and entered a vast, dark cavern.

In the center of the cavern, bathed in a soft, ethereal light, was a glowing stone. Hans approached it cautiously, his heart pounding in his chest. As he touched the stone, it pulsed with energy, and a voice echoed through the cavern.

""You have found the first stone, Hans. You are one step closer to freeing me.""

With a renewed sense of purpose, Hans continued his journey, seeking the remaining stones. He faced numerous trials and tribulations, but each time, he emerged victorious.

After what felt like a lifetime, Hans found himself standing before the entrance to a hidden grove. The Spirit of the Forest had told him that the final stone was hidden within this sacred place.

As Hans stepped into the grove, he was greeted by a breathtaking sight. In the center of the grove, surrounded by a ring of ancient, gnarled trees, was a crystal-clear pool. In the pool, the third stone glimmered, its surface shimmering with an otherworldly light.

Hans approached the pool, his heart pounding with anticipation. As he reached out to touch the stone, a sudden gust of wind swept through the grove, and the Spirit of the Forest appeared before him.

""Thank you, Hans,"" she said, her voice filled with gratitude. ""With these stones, I can finally break free from the sorcerer's curse and return to my true form.""

With a wave of her hand, the Spirit of the Forest transformed into a radiant, ethereal being. She thanked Hans once more and, with a final, warm smile, disappeared into the mist.

Hans returned to Schwarzwald a hero, his deeds forever etched in the hearts and minds of the villagers. And though he never saw the Spirit of the Forest again, he knew that he had played a part in preserving the harmony of the Black Forest.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the trees grew tall and the rivers flowed deep, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. He was a man of simple pleasures, content with his life and the company of his faithful dog, Schatzi.

One day, while Hans was out in the forest, chopping wood for the winter, he heard a strange sound. It was a soft, melodious voice, singing a song he had never heard before. Intrigued, he followed the sound until he came upon a small, hidden glade. There, beneath an ancient oak tree, he saw a beautiful maiden. Her hair was as golden as the sun, and her eyes sparkled like the stars. She was singing a hauntingly beautiful song, her voice as sweet as the birdsong that filled the forest.

Hans was captivated by the maiden's beauty and her enchanting voice. He approached her cautiously, not wanting to disturb her. ""Fraulein,"" he said, ""I have never heard such a beautiful song. May I ask who you are?""

The maiden looked up and smiled at Hans. ""I am the Forest Queen,"" she said. ""I have been singing to the forest to keep it healthy and strong. But I have been growing weaker, and I fear that the forest is in danger.""

Hans was alarmed. ""What can I do to help?"" he asked.

The Forest Queen looked at him thoughtfully. ""There is a powerful magic hidden deep within the forest,"" she said. ""It is guarded by a fearsome dragon. If you can retrieve the magic and bring it back to me, I will regain my strength and the forest will be saved.""

Hans was determined to help. He thanked the Forest Queen and set off into the depths of the forest, Schatzi by his side. They journeyed for many days, facing many dangers and challenges. But Hans was brave and strong, and Schatzi was always by his side.

Finally, they came to a dark cave, guarded by the fearsome dragon. Hans and Schatzi approached cautiously, ready for battle. But to their surprise, the dragon spoke to them. ""I am the guardian of the magic,"" the dragon said. ""But I will not give it to you without a test. You must answer three riddles, or you will not be able to pass.""

Hans was not afraid. He and the dragon began to exchange riddles, each one more difficult than the last. But Hans was clever, and he answered each riddle correctly. The dragon was impressed. ""Very well,"" he said. ""You have passed my test. The magic is yours.""

Hans and Schatzi returned to the glade, where the Forest Queen was waiting for them. Hans presented the magic to her, and she thanked him profusely. ""You have saved the forest,"" she said. ""And for that, I will grant you a wish.""

Hans thought for a moment. ""I wish for nothing for myself,"" he said. ""But I wish for the people of the village to always have enough food, and for the forest to always be a source of strength and beauty for them.""

The Forest Queen smiled. ""Your wish is granted,"" she said. ""From this day forward, the people of the village will never go hungry, and the forest will always be a source of life and joy for them.""

Hans returned to his humble home, his heart full of pride. He knew that he had done something truly great, and he was content. He lived out the rest of his days in peace, knowing that he had saved the forest and the people he loved.

And so the story goes, passed down from generation to generation, of the humble woodcutter who saved the Black Forest. The End.

","In a quaint village nestled between the rolling hills of Bavaria, there lived a humble cobbler named Hans. His shop, with its wooden sign etched with the image of a well-crafted boot, was the pride of the town. His shoes were known far and wide for their quality, and he was beloved by all who entered his shop.

One day, as Hans was working on a pair of boots, an old woman entered his shop. She was hunched over, her back bent with age, and her clothes were tattered and worn. Hans greeted her warmly, offering her a seat by the fire.

""I have come to you, dear Hans, for a pair of boots,"" she said, her voice as rough as the roads she had traveled. ""But not just any boots. I need a pair that will carry me to the hidden treasure of the Witch of the Black Forest.""

Hans was taken aback. He had heard tales of the Witch and her treasure, but he had never believed them to be true. Still, he knew that the old woman was desperate, and he couldn't bear to turn her away.

""Very well,"" he said, ""I will make you a pair of boots, but I make no promises. The Witch is a powerful being, and I cannot guarantee that they will lead you to her treasure.""

The old woman nodded, her eyes shining with gratitude. Hans worked tirelessly for several days, crafting a pair of boots unlike any he had ever made before. They were black as the night sky, with intricate patterns woven into the leather. When they were finished, he presented them to the old woman, who took them in her gnarled hands.

""Thank you, Hans,"" she said, her voice trembling with emotion. ""I will return and tell you of my journey.""

The old woman set off into the forest, the boots creaking softly with each step. Days turned into weeks, and still, she did not return. Hans began to worry, but he told himself that she had found the treasure and was enjoying her newfound wealth.

One day, as the sun was setting, a knock came at Hans' door. He opened it to find the old woman, her face glowing with happiness.

""Hans, I have found the treasure!"" she exclaimed. ""The boots worked! I have brought you a small token of my gratitude.""

She reached into her bag and pulled out a golden coin, larger and more beautiful than any Hans had ever seen.

""But that's not all,"" she continued. ""The Witch has asked me to return the boots, but she has granted me one wish. What would you like?""

Hans was speechless. He thought of all the things he could ask for - wealth, fame, power - but none of them seemed important compared to the happiness of his village.

""I wish for the happiness and prosperity of my village,"" he said finally.

The old woman nodded, her eyes shining with understanding. She returned the boots to Hans, who placed them back in his shop window. From that day on, the village flourished, and the people lived in peace and harmony.

The End.

Hans' shop continued to thrive, and the story of the old woman and the Witch of the Black Forest became a beloved tale in the village. Hans never made another pair of boots like the ones he had crafted for the old woman, but he never forgot the lesson they had taught him - that sometimes, the greatest treasure is not wealth or fame, but the happiness and prosperity of the people we love.

And so, the story of Hans and the old woman lived on, a reminder of the magic that can be found in the simplest of things and the power of a selfless act. The End.

This story is a traditional German folktale that I have written, inspired by the folklore and storytelling traditions of Germany. It is a tale of magic, adventure, and the power of selflessness, and it showcases the importance of community and the happiness of others over personal gain. The story is set in a quaint village in Bavaria, and it features a humble cobbler named Hans who crafts a pair of magical boots for an old woman in search of the Witch of the Black Forest's treasure. The story ends with Hans making a selfless wish for the happiness and prosperity of his village, and the old woman granting it. The story serves as a reminder of the magic that can be found in the simplest of things and the power of a selfless act."

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the towering trees stood like sentinels and the air was always thick with the scent of pine, there was a small village called Schwarzwald. The villagers were simple folk, living off the land and the forest, and they had a deep respect for the natural world.

Among them was a young woman named Elise, who was known for her beauty and her kind heart. She was the daughter of the village blacksmith, and she spent her days helping her father in the forge and her evenings weaving intricate tapestries.

One day, as Elise was walking through the forest to gather firewood, she came across a small, shimmering pool. As she bent down to drink, she saw a pair of eyes watching her from the water. It was a fish, unlike any she had ever seen before, with scales that sparkled like gold and eyes that seemed to hold a wisdom beyond its years.

""Greetings, fair maiden,"" the fish said in a voice that was deep and melodious. ""I am the Wish Fish, and I grant one wish to those who find me. What is your desire?""

Elise was taken aback. She had never heard of a Wish Fish before, and she couldn't think of anything she wanted more than to live a simple, happy life in the village she loved.

""I wish for nothing,"" she said finally. ""I have everything I need.""

The Wish Fish looked at her with surprise. ""Very well,"" it said. ""But if you should ever find yourself in need, return to this pool and make your wish then.""

Elise thanked the Wish Fish and continued on her way, feeling a strange sense of peace wash over her.

Years passed, and Elise grew into a woman of great beauty and wisdom. She married a kind and gentle man, and they had a son who was the light of their lives. But as time went on, the village began to change. The forest grew darker, and strange creatures began to appear.

One day, a band of marauders came to the village, demanding food and gold. Elise's husband was killed in the ensuing fight, and the villagers were left to fend for themselves.

Elise knew that she couldn't protect her son on her own, and so she remembered the Wish Fish and the promise it had made to her long ago. She gathered her family and set out for the shimmering pool, praying that the Wish Fish would still be there.

As she reached the pool, she saw the Wish Fish swimming towards her. ""I have come to make my wish,"" she said. ""I wish for the safety and happiness of my son and the people of Schwarzwald.""

The Wish Fish looked at her with understanding. ""Your wish is granted,"" it said. ""But know this, fair maiden. The darkness that has come to your village will not be easily vanquished. You must be strong, and you must be wise. And when the time comes, you must call upon the power within you to protect all that you hold dear.""

Elise thanked the Wish Fish and returned to the village, determined to fight for her son and her people. And as the years went by, she became a fierce and fearless warrior, leading the villagers in battle against the marauders and driving them back into the darkness from whence they came.

The village of Schwarzwald was saved, and Elise's son grew up to be a strong and noble man, just like his mother. And they lived happily ever after, surrounded by the towering trees of the Black Forest, and protected by the wisdom of the Wish Fish.

The End.

This story is a retelling of the German folktale ""The Wish Fish"" with some changes and additions to make it more engaging and appropriate for a modern audience. The story is set in a fictional village and features a strong female protagonist who uses her wisdom and courage to protect her family and her community. The story also includes a magical element in the form of the Wish Fish, which serves as a symbol of hope and possibility. Overall, the story is a celebration of the power of determination, love, and community in the face of adversity."

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the towering pine trees whispered secrets to the wind, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. His life was simple, and he was content, for he had a warm hearth, a loving wife, and a heart full of songs.

One day, while Hans was chopping wood in the forest, he heard a faint melody wafting through the trees. Intrigued, he followed the music, and to his surprise, he found a tiny, golden flute lying on a bed of moss. As he picked it up, the flute began to play a beautiful, enchanting tune.

Hans was overjoyed and decided to take the flute home. As soon as he played it, his humble cabin was filled with the most beautiful music he had ever heard. His wife, Maria, was amazed and asked him where he had found such a marvelous instrument. Hans told her about the flute he found in the forest, and Maria urged him to keep it.

Days turned into weeks, and the golden flute became a part of Hans's life. He played it every day, and the music brought joy to his heart and to his home. But one day, as Hans was playing the flute, he noticed that the music seemed to change. It was still beautiful, but there was a sadness to it that he had never heard before.

Hans was puzzled, but he continued to play the flute, hoping that the music would return to its original, joyful state. But the sadness remained, and Hans could not shake the feeling that something was wrong.

One night, as Hans was playing the flute by the fire, a strange, old man appeared before him. The man introduced himself as the spirit of the forest, and he told Hans that the golden flute belonged to him.

""I have been searching for my flute for centuries,"" the spirit said. ""A long time ago, I made this flute for a beautiful princess who lived in a castle deep within the forest. But one day, a wicked sorcerer stole the flute and used it to cast a spell on the princess, causing her to fall into an eternal sleep. I have been searching for the flute ever since, hoping to break the spell and wake the princess.""

Hans was shocked and felt a pang of guilt. He had been playing the flute every day, unaware of the sorrow it had caused. He apologized to the spirit and promised to return the flute to him.

The spirit thanked Hans and gave him a small, golden key. ""This key will open the castle where the princess sleeps,"" he said. ""Take the flute back to the castle, and play it for the princess. She will awaken, and the spell will be broken.""

Hans thanked the spirit and set off on his journey, carrying the golden flute and the small, golden key. He traveled deep into the forest, following the spirit's directions, and finally arrived at the castle.

The castle was beautiful, with towering spires and intricate carvings. Hans found a grand hall, and as he entered, he saw the princess, lying in a crystal coffin, surrounded by a golden light.

Hans approached the coffin and played the golden flute. The music filled the hall, and the princess stirred. Her eyes fluttered open, and she looked around, bewildered.

""Who are you?"" she asked Hans. ""How did you find me?""

Hans told her the story of the golden flute and the spirit of the forest. The princess listened, her eyes filled with tears. ""Thank you,"" she said. ""I have been asleep for so long, and I thought I would never wake up.""

The princess thanked Hans and asked him to stay with her. But Hans knew that he could not stay. He had a life to return to, and he wanted to share the joy of the golden flute with Maria.

The princess understood and gave Hans a small, golden locket. ""This locket will always remind you of me,"" she said. ""And if you ever need my help, just play the golden flute, and I will come to you.""

Hans thanked the princess and left the castle, his heart heavy but filled with joy. He returned the golden flute to the spirit of the forest, who thanked him and blessed him.

Hans returned home, and Maria was overjoyed to see him. He told her the story of the golden flute and the princess, and Maria listened, her eyes filled with tears.

From that day on, Hans played the golden flute every day, and the music brought joy to his heart and to his home. And every now and then, as he played, he would hear the princess's laughter echoing through the forest, reminding him of the magic that lay hidden within the Black Forest.

","In a small, secluded village nestled in the heart of the Black Forest, there lived a humble shoemaker named Hans. His life was simple and content, and he was well-loved by all. However, he had a secret desire that he kept hidden from the villagers: he longed to create a pair of shoes that could transport its wearer to any place in the world.

One day, as Hans was working on a pair of boots, he found a strange, shimmering feather among the leather scraps. He picked it up and, as he did, a soft voice whispered, ""With this feather and a heart full of longing, you can create the shoes of your dreams.""

Hans was amazed and a little scared, but he knew he had to try. He gathered the finest materials he could find and, with the shimmering feather in his hand, he began to work. He sewed and stitched, day and night, until the shoes were finally complete.

As he placed the shoes on his feet, Hans felt a strange sensation, as if the world around him was shifting. He closed his eyes and whispered a silent prayer, then took a deep breath and opened his eyes.

To his astonishment, he found himself standing in a beautiful, sunlit meadow, surrounded by flowers and trees. He looked down at his feet, and the shoes were gone. In their place were a pair of simple, everyday shoes, but he knew they were the same ones he had just made.

Hans was overjoyed and spent the day exploring the meadow, marveling at the beauty around him. But as the sun began to set, he realized he had to return to his village. He closed his eyes and whispered a silent prayer, then opened his eyes and found himself back in his small, secluded village.

The villagers were shocked to see him, and he quickly explained what had happened. They were amazed and asked if he would take them to see the world. Hans agreed and, with the help of the magical shoes, he took them on a journey they would never forget. They saw the pyramids of Egypt, the Great Wall of China, and the Eiffel Tower in Paris. They even visited the moon!

But as they traveled, Hans began to feel a strange emptiness inside him. He realized that, in his quest to see the world, he had forgotten about the simple, content life he had once known. He missed the quiet, peaceful village and the friends he had left behind.

Hans returned to the village, but he was no longer the same. He was restless and unhappy, and the villagers could see it. They tried to cheer him up, but nothing seemed to help.

One day, as Hans was sitting by the river, he saw a group of travelers approaching. They were weary and worn, and Hans could see that they were in need of help. He invited them to stay in his home, and he took care of them as best he could.

As he helped the travelers, Hans began to feel a sense of peace and contentment that he had not felt in a long time. He realized that, in his quest to see the world, he had forgotten the true meaning of happiness: helping others and being kind.

Hans continued to help travelers for many years, and he became known as the kindest man in the village. He never again wore the magical shoes, but he never forgot the lesson they had taught him: that true happiness comes from helping others and being kind.

And so, Hans lived out the rest of his days in peace and contentment, surrounded by the friends he had made and the villagers who loved him. And whenever a traveler passed through the village, they would always stop by Hans's house, to say thank you and to remember the kind man who had once shown them the true meaning of happiness.

","In a quaint little village nestled between the dense forests of the Black Forest, there lived a kind-hearted miller named Hans. He was a man of simple pleasures, content with his humble abode and the company of his beloved wife, Maria.

One day, while tending to his mill, Hans noticed a peculiar old man, clad in tattered rags, standing by the millstream. The old man's eyes sparkled with an otherworldly wisdom, and he carried an air of mystery about him.

""Good day, miller,"" the old man greeted Hans, his voice as smooth as the flowing water. ""I have heard much about your mill. It is said that it grinds not only grain but also secrets.""

Hans, taken aback, replied, ""I am but a simple miller, sir. I grind grain for the villagers and nothing more.""

The old man chuckled, ""Ah, but there is more to your mill than meets the eye. I can see it in your eyes, young man. You possess a secret, one that could change the course of your life.""

Intrigued, Hans invited the old man into his home, where he shared a meal with Maria. As they dined, the old man told Hans a tale of a hidden treasure, buried deep within the Black Forest, guarded by a fearsome dragon.

""But the dragon is not the only guardian, Hans,"" the old man warned. ""There is a magical golden key, hidden in the heart of the forest, that can open the treasure chest. The key is protected by a spell, and only a pure heart can break it.""

Hans, filled with dreams of wealth and prosperity, decided to embark on the quest. He bid farewell to his wife, promising to return with riches beyond their wildest dreams.

Days turned into weeks, and weeks into months. Hans ventured deeper into the forest, facing numerous trials and tribulations. He encountered a river of lava, a field of thorns, and a labyrinth of dark caves. But his pure heart guided him, and he emerged unscathed.

Finally, he arrived at the heart of the forest, where the golden key lay, encased in a crystal orb. As he reached for the orb, a voice echoed through the forest, ""Only a selfless act can break the spell.""

Hans, remembering the kindness he had shown to the villagers, knew what he had to do. He returned to his village, where he gave away all his possessions to the needy. The villagers, touched by his generosity, showered him with love and gratitude.

With a heart full of joy and contentment, Hans returned to the heart of the forest. He touched the crystal orb, and the golden key was released. As he approached the treasure chest, the fearsome dragon appeared, its eyes glowing with fury.

""I have completed my quest,"" Hans declared, his voice steady and firm. ""I have proven my pure heart.""

The dragon, surprised by Hans' bravery, asked, ""What do you seek, young man?""

""I seek not wealth or power, but the well-being of my village,"" Hans replied.

The dragon, moved by Hans' selflessness, transformed into a beautiful maiden. ""You have passed the final test, Hans. Take the treasure and use it to bring prosperity to your village.""

Hans returned to his village, where he used the treasure to build schools, hospitals, and homes for the needy. The villagers lived happily ever after, and Hans, content with his simple life, continued to mill the grain, his heart forever pure.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, nestled between towering pine trees and shrouded in a veil of mist, lay the quaint village of Schwarzwald. The villagers lived in harmony with nature, their lives dictated by the rhythm of the seasons. Among them was a humble woodcutter named Hans, who was known for his strength, kindness, and unwavering work ethic.

One day, while Hans was out in the forest, chopping wood to provide for his family, he stumbled upon a peculiar sight. A small, golden bird with feathers as bright as the sun was trapped in a thorny bush. Hans carefully approached the bird, not wanting to scare it, and gently freed it from the bush.

""Thank you, kind woodcutter,"" the bird chirped, its voice as melodious as a lark's. ""As a token of my gratitude, I shall grant you three wishes. You may ask for anything your heart desires.""

Hans was taken aback by the bird's words. He had heard tales of magical creatures, but he had never encountered one himself. He pondered for a moment, considering what he could ask for that would truly make a difference in his life.

""I wish for a bountiful harvest for my family and the village,"" Hans finally said, his voice filled with gratitude. The golden bird nodded, and with a flash of light, the wish was granted. The fields of Schwarzwald bloomed with vibrant crops, and the villagers rejoiced.

A few months later, Hans found himself in need once more. The harsh winter had come early, and the village was struggling to keep warm. He remembered the golden bird and its offer of three wishes.

""Golden bird,"" he called out, hoping the bird was still nearby. ""I wish for a plentiful supply of firewood to keep my family and the village warm during the cold winter months.""

The bird appeared before him, and with another flash of light, the wish was granted. The forest seemed to yield an endless supply of firewood, and the villagers were able to stay warm and cozy.

As the winter drew to a close, Hans realized that he had only one wish left. He thought long and hard about what he could ask for that would truly make a difference in his life and the lives of his fellow villagers.

""Golden bird,"" he said, his voice filled with determination. ""I wish for the village of Schwarzwald to be protected from harm and to flourish for generations to come.""

The bird nodded, and with a final flash of light, the wish was granted. The village was shielded from harm, and it continued to thrive for many years to come.

Hans lived out the rest of his days in peace, his heart filled with gratitude for the golden bird's kindness. He passed on the tale of the golden bird and its three wishes to his children and grandchildren, and the story became a cherished part of Schwarzwald's folklore.

And so, the village of Schwarzwald continued to flourish, a testament to the power of kindness and the magic of the unknown. The golden bird, though unseen, was never forgotten, and its legacy lived on in the hearts of the villagers.

The End.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the trees stood tall and the air was thick with the scent of pine, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. His life was simple and peaceful, and he was content with his solitary existence.

One day, as Hans was making his way through the forest, he stumbled upon a peculiar sight. A tiny, shimmering door had appeared at the base of an ancient oak tree. Intrigued, he approached it and, to his surprise, the door swung open.

On the other side, Hans found a room smaller than a bird's nest, yet it was filled with the most exquisite treasures he had ever seen. Gold and silver, jewels and precious stones, all glittered and sparkled in the soft light.

""Welcome, Hans,"" a voice spoke, and Hans turned to see a tiny, old woman sitting on a tiny, golden throne. ""I am the Queen of the Elves. You have discovered our hidden realm, and I have a task for you.""

""What task could I possibly do for you?"" Hans asked, his eyes wide with wonder.

""I need a human to help me find my lost magic mirror,"" the Queen explained. ""It was stolen by a wicked sorcerer, and I fear he will use it for evil purposes. In return, I will give you three wishes.""

Hans agreed, and the Queen handed him a tiny, golden key. ""This will unlock the doors to the sorcerer's castle. Be careful, for he is cunning and dangerous. You must find the mirror and return it to me.""

With a heavy heart, Hans left the elf realm and made his way to the sorcerer's castle. The castle was dark and foreboding, and Hans could feel the evil that emanated from it. He took a deep breath and stepped inside.

The castle was filled with twisting corridors and hidden traps, but Hans was determined to find the mirror. He searched for hours, his heart pounding with fear and excitement. At last, he found the room where the mirror was kept.

The sorcerer was there, his eyes glowing with malice as he laughed at Hans. ""You fool! You think you can take the mirror from me?""

Hans stood his ground, his eyes locked with the sorcerer's. ""I will take the mirror and return it to the Queen of the Elves,"" he declared.

The sorcerer sneered and raised his staff, but before he could cast a spell, Hans grabbed the mirror and ran. He could hear the sorcerer's angry shouts behind him, but he didn't look back.

Back in the elf realm, Hans returned the mirror to the Queen. ""Thank you, Hans,"" she said, her eyes shining with gratitude. ""You have done a great deed, and now it is time for your rewards.""

Hans hesitated, unsure of what to wish for. He thought of wealth and power, but in the end, he knew what he truly wanted. ""I wish for a loving wife and a family of my own,"" he said.

The Queen nodded and granted his wish. Hans left the elf realm, his heart filled with joy.

Months passed, and Hans married a kind and beautiful woman named Maria. Together, they had three children, and their home was filled with love and laughter.

One day, as Hans was walking through the forest, he heard a familiar voice calling his name. He turned to see the Queen of the Elves, who looked much older now.

""Hans, I have one more task for you,"" she said. ""I am growing weak, and I need someone to take my place as the guardian of the elf realm. Will you do it?""

Hans was surprised, but he knew he couldn't refuse. ""I will do it,"" he said. ""I will protect your realm and your people.""

The Queen smiled and handed him a tiny, golden crown. ""Thank you, Hans,"" she said. ""You have been a true friend to us, and I know you will do well.""

And so, Hans became the guardian of the elf realm, and he lived out the rest of his days in peace and contentment. He never forgot the adventures he had in the Black Forest, and he passed the stories down to his children and grandchildren.

","In a quaint village nestled in the heart of the Black Forest, there lived a humble cobbler named Hans. His shop was a simple wooden structure, filled with the aroma of fresh leather and the rhythmic sound of his hammer.

One day, as Hans was returning home from the market, he stumbled upon a peculiar object. It was a small, golden key, glinting in the sunlight. Intrigued, he picked it up and noticed a small, intricate inscription on its handle: ""The key to a hidden treasure.""

Hans was a man of simple means, and the thought of discovering a treasure filled him with excitement. He spent the rest of the day searching his home and shop, but found no hidden compartments or secret doors.

The next day, he decided to ask the village elder for advice. The elder, a wise old man with a long, flowing beard, listened to Hans' story with a knowing smile. ""That key,"" he said, ""belongs to the legendary Treasure of the Forest. It is said to be hidden deep within the forest, guarded by a fearsome creature.""

Hans' heart pounded with anticipation. He thanked the elder and set off into the forest, the golden key clutched tightly in his hand. The forest was dense and dark, and Hans soon found himself lost. He walked for hours, his footsteps echoing through the trees.

Suddenly, he heard a low growl. Turning around, he saw a massive, shaggy creature with glowing eyes. It was a werewolf, and it was advancing towards him.

Hans was terrified, but he remembered the elder's words. ""I have come for the Treasure of the Forest,"" he said, holding up the golden key. The werewolf stopped, its eyes widening in recognition.

""You have come for the treasure,"" the werewolf growled. ""But first, you must prove your worth. Solve the riddle I give you, and I will show you the treasure. Fail, and you will never leave this forest.""

Hans gulped, but he was determined. ""I accept your challenge,"" he said.

The werewolf snarled and spoke the riddle: ""What walks on four legs in the morning, two legs at noon, and three legs in the evening?""

Hans thought for a moment, then a smile spread across his face. ""A man,"" he said. ""As a baby, he crawls on all fours. As an adult, he walks on two legs. And in old age, he uses a cane, making him walk with three legs.""

The werewolf roared in surprise and admiration. ""You have solved my riddle,"" it said. ""As promised, I will show you the treasure.""

The werewolf led Hans to a hidden cave, deep within the forest. Inside, there was a massive chest, filled with gold and jewels. Hans' eyes widened in awe.

""This is the Treasure of the Forest,"" the werewolf said. ""It is yours, if you promise to use it wisely.""

Hans nodded, his heart pounding with excitement. He opened the chest and filled his pockets with gold and jewels. As he turned to leave, he thanked the werewolf and promised to use the treasure wisely.

Hans returned to his village, a wealthy man. He used the treasure to build a beautiful home, a grand shop, and a school for the children. He lived a happy, fulfilling life, always remembering the lesson he learned in the forest: that wealth and power should be used wisely.

And so, the story of Hans and the Treasure of the Forest became a legend in the village, a tale of courage, wisdom, and the power of a good riddle.

","In a small, secluded village nestled between the dense, towering Black Forest, there lived a humble miller named Hans. He was a kind and hardworking man, known for his strong arms and steady hands. His mill, an old, wooden structure, stood by the river, its waterwheel turning day and night, grinding the grains into flour.

Hans had a daughter, Agnes, who was as beautiful as the sun and as gentle as the morning breeze. She was the light of the miller's life, and he doted on her, shielding her from the harsh realities of the world.

One day, a stranger arrived in the village. He was tall, with a long, flowing beard and piercing eyes that seemed to see right through a person. The villagers were wary of him, but Hans, ever the hospitable man, welcomed him into his home.

The stranger, who introduced himself as the Count of the Black Forest, was a scholar and a traveler. He had heard tales of the miller's daughter and was captivated by her beauty. He asked Hans for Agnes's hand in marriage, and though Hans was hesitant, he could not deny the Count's charm and wealth.

Agnes, however, was not so easily swayed. She had a feeling that the Count was not all that he seemed. She remembered the tales her grandmother used to tell her about the forest and the creatures that lurked within. She knew that the forest was full of magic, both good and evil, and she feared that the Count was a creature of the latter.

One night, as the moon shone brightly, Agnes decided to venture into the forest to seek the truth. She took with her a small lantern and a piece of bread, hoping that the light and the scent would guide her back home.

As she walked deeper into the forest, the trees grew taller and the air grew colder. She could hear the rustling of leaves and the hooting of owls, but she pressed on, determined to uncover the Count's secret.

Suddenly, she came upon a clearing, and there, in the center, stood a magnificent, ancient tree. Its branches stretched out, touching the sky, and its roots dug deep into the earth. At the base of the tree, there was a small, hidden door.

Agnes approached the tree cautiously, her heart pounding in her chest. She reached out and touched the door, and it swung open, revealing a dark, dusty chamber. She hesitated for a moment, then stepped inside.

The chamber was filled with books and scrolls, all written in a language she did not understand. But as she looked closer, she realized that the words were moving, changing, and forming into images. She saw pictures of the Count, but they were not of a man, but of a fearsome, winged creature with glowing eyes.

Agnes gasped in shock and fear, but she knew that she could not leave without proof. She quickly gathered as many scrolls as she could carry and made her way back to the clearing.

As she emerged from the forest, she saw the Count standing by the river, waiting for her. He looked at her with a cold, calculating gaze, and she knew that he had sensed her presence in the forest.

""Agnes,"" he said, his voice like ice, ""I have been waiting for you. I knew that you would come.""

""I have seen the truth,"" Agnes said, holding up the scrolls. ""You are not a man, but a creature of the forest. I will not marry you.""

The Count's eyes flashed with anger, and he lunged at Agnes, but she was quick, and she dodged his grasp. She ran back to the mill, her heart pounding in her chest.

Hans, who had been waiting up for her, saw her running towards him, the scrolls in her hands. He took one look at them and knew that she had been telling the truth.

""Agnes, my dear,"" he said, tears in his eyes, ""I am sorry that I could not see the truth. You were right to be wary of the Count.""

The villagers, who had been watching the scene unfold, gathered around Agnes and Hans, their faces a mix of shock and relief. They knew that the Count was a creature of the forest, and they were grateful that Agnes had uncovered his true nature.

The Count, realizing that he had been exposed, fled the village, never to be seen again. Agnes and Hans were hailed as heroes, and the villagers celebrated their bravery.

From that day on, Agnes was known as the Brave Maiden of the Black Forest, and her story was told for generations to come. And every time the wind whispered through the trees, the villagers could hear her laughter, a reminder of the courage that lay within them all.

","Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between the rolling hills and the dense forest, lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. He was known for his strength, kindness, and unwavering work ethic. One day, while chopping wood in the forest, he stumbled upon a peculiar, shimmering stone.

Intrigued, Hans picked up the stone and felt a strange warmth emanating from it. Suddenly, a soft voice echoed from the stone, ""Thank you for finding me, Hans. I am the Wishing Stone, and I grant three wishes to the one who finds me.""

Hans, surprised and a bit skeptical, replied, ""I am but a humble woodcutter. I do not need riches or power. I wish for the well-being of my family and the villagers.""

The Wishing Stone glowed brighter, and a sense of peace washed over Hans. He returned to the village, and indeed, a sense of prosperity seemed to have fallen upon them. The crops grew bountiful, the animals were healthy, and the villagers were content.

Years passed, and Hans' family grew. He had two sons, Karl and Friedrich, who were as strong and kind as their father. One day, Karl fell gravely ill. The village healer did all he could, but Karl's condition worsened. Hans, desperate, remembered the Wishing Stone.

With a heavy heart, he returned to the forest and knelt before the stone. ""I wish for my son, Karl, to be healed,"" he said.

The Wishing Stone glowed once more, and a gentle light enveloped Karl. When Hans returned to the village, he found Karl sitting up in bed, his color restored and his eyes filled with life.

Years passed again, and Friedrich, the younger son, grew restless. He longed for adventure and left the village to explore the world. One day, he was captured by pirates and taken to a distant land. Hans, again desperate, remembered the Wishing Stone.

He returned to the forest, his heart heavy with worry. ""I wish for my son, Friedrich, to be returned safely to me,"" he said.

The Wishing Stone glowed once more, and a storm raged across the sea. The pirates were shipwrecked, and Friedrich was found, unharmed, washed ashore. When Hans received the news, he wept tears of joy.

Hans, now an old man, looked at the Wishing Stone one last time. ""I have used my wishes. I have no more,"" he said.

The Wishing Stone glowed one last time, and Hans felt a sense of peace. ""You have used your wishes wisely, Hans. You have ensured the well-being of your family and the villagers. You have nothing more to wish for.""

And with that, the Wishing Stone disappeared, leaving behind a simple stone in the heart of the forest. Hans returned to his village, content and at peace, knowing he had done all he could for his family and the villagers.

The story ends with Hans feeling content and at peace, knowing he has done all he could for his loved ones.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, where the towering pine trees whispered ancient secrets to the wind, there lived a humble woodcutter named Hans. His life was simple, and he was content, for he had a loving wife, a warm hearth, and a heart full of songs.

One day, while Hans was out in the forest, chopping wood, he heard a strange sound. It was a melody, sweet and haunting, that seemed to echo from the very heart of the forest. Intrigued, he followed the sound, and soon he came upon a clearing. There, under the dappled shade of an ancient oak, he saw a beautiful maiden. She was weaving a garland of flowers, her laughter like the tinkling of silver bells.

Hans approached her, his heart pounding with a mix of fear and wonder. The maiden looked up, her eyes sparkling like the stars, and she greeted him warmly. ""Greetings, kind woodcutter,"" she said. ""I am the Forest Spirit, and I have been waiting for you.""

""I am Hans,"" he replied, bowing low. ""Why have you been waiting for me?""

""I have a task for you, Hans,"" the Forest Spirit said. ""There is a wicked witch who lives in a castle on the other side of the forest. She has stolen my magic, and I cannot leave the forest until I have it back. Will you help me?""

Hans hesitated, for he knew that the witch was feared by all, and many had tried to confront her and failed. But he also knew that the Forest Spirit was kind and beautiful, and he could not refuse her. ""I will help you, Forest Spirit,"" he said, and the forest seemed to tremble with his words.

The Forest Spirit smiled, and she gave him a small, golden acorn. ""Take this acorn, Hans,"" she said. ""It is a seed of truth. When you reach the witch's castle, plant it in the ground, and it will reveal the truth about her. But be careful, for the witch is cunning and cruel.""

With a final farewell, Hans set off towards the witch's castle. The forest seemed to close in around him, the trees whispering dark secrets as he passed. He could feel the weight of the task upon his shoulders, and he prayed that he would be strong enough to complete it.

After what felt like an eternity, he finally reached the castle. It was a towering, dark structure, with spires that pierced the sky like the fingers of a skeleton. Hans approached the castle gates, his heart pounding in his chest.

The gates creaked open, and he stepped into the courtyard. The air was thick with the stench of death, and he could see the shadows of skeletons dancing in the moonlight. He knew that he must be careful, for the witch was cunning and cruel.

He made his way to the castle, and he could hear the sound of laughter and music coming from within. He followed the sound, and soon he found himself in a grand ballroom. The witch was there, a beautiful, but evil, woman, dancing with a group of skeletons.

Hans approached the witch, the golden acorn clutched tightly in his hand. ""I have come to take back the magic of the Forest Spirit,"" he said, his voice steady and strong.

The witch laughed, a cold, cruel sound that sent shivers down his spine. ""You think you can take back what is mine?"" she sneered. ""I am the most powerful witch in the land, and no one can stand against me.""

""I have the seed of truth,"" Hans said, holding up the acorn. ""Plant it, and it will reveal the truth about you.""

The witch's laughter died in her throat, and her eyes narrowed. ""You fool,"" she hissed. ""You think a simple seed can defeat me?""

Without another word, she reached for the acorn, but Hans was faster. He planted the acorn in the ground, and the ballroom was filled with a bright, golden light. The skeletons shuddered and crumbled to dust, and the witch's eyes widened in shock.

""I am not the most powerful witch in the land,"" she cried. ""I am a fraud, a charlatan, who has stolen the magic of the Forest Spirit to feed my own greed. I have no power here.""

The witch's words echoed through the ballroom, and the walls began to crumble. Hans watched as the witch was consumed by her own castle, her screams of rage and terror filling the air.

With a final, triumphant cry, Hans left the castle, the magic of the Forest Spirit restored. He returned to his home, where the Forest Spirit awaited him. She thanked him for his bravery, and she gave him a gift - a golden flute that could play the most beautiful music in the world.

Hans played the flute every night, and the forest seemed to come alive with the music. The trees whispered their secrets to the wind, and the animals danced and sang along. Hans was content, for he had helped the Forest Spirit, and he had a heart full of music.

And so, the story of Hans and the Forest Spirit is told in the Black Forest, a tale of bravery and magic, of love and music. And the forest, with its towering pine trees and whispering secrets, continues to echo the tale, a testament to the power of a humble woodcutter and a beautiful maiden.

","In the heart of the Black Forest, nestled among the towering evergreens, lay a quaint little village known as Schwarzwald. The villagers lived in harmony with nature, their lives dictated by the rhythm of the seasons. The village was home to many tales and legends, but none were as captivating as the story of the Enchanted Forest.

The Enchanted Forest was a mystical place, shrouded in an ethereal glow, where the air was thick with magic. It was said that the forest was home to a wise old witch named Frau Holle. She was a benevolent sorceress, known for her kindness and wisdom, but she was also feared for her unpredictable temper.

One day, a young girl named Greta ventured into the Enchanted Forest in search of her lost sheep. Greta was a simple girl, with a heart full of courage and a spirit full of curiosity. She was not afraid of the unknown, and she was determined to find her beloved sheep, Bianca.

As Greta ventured deeper into the forest, she felt a strange sensation wash over her. The air grew colder, and the trees seemed to whisper secrets to her. She followed the whispers, her heart pounding in her chest. Suddenly, she found herself standing before a large, ancient oak tree.

Greta approached the tree, her heart pounding in her chest. As she reached out to touch the rough bark, the tree suddenly came to life. It opened its branches, revealing a small door. Greta hesitated for a moment, but her determination overcame her fear. She stepped through the door and found herself in Frau Holle's cottage.

Frau Holle was a formidable sight. She was tall and thin, with a wizened face and long, flowing white hair. Her eyes twinkled with mischief, and she wore a long, flowing gown made of leaves and flowers. Greta curtsied respectfully, explaining her mission.

Frau Holle listened intently, her eyes narrowing as she considered Greta's request. ""I will help you find your sheep, but you must promise me something in return,"" she said, her voice as soft as a whisper.

""Anything, Frau Holle,"" Greta replied eagerly.

""You must promise to return to the Enchanted Forest every year on my birthday and bring me a gift. It can be anything, as long as it comes from your heart,"" Frau Holle said.

Greta agreed without hesitation, and Frau Holle nodded, her eyes twinkling with approval. She waved her hand, and a vision appeared before Greta. She saw Bianca, safe and sound, grazing in a lush meadow.

Greta thanked Frau Holle and rushed back to the village, her heart filled with joy. She found Bianca exactly where Frau Holle had shown her, and she hugged her sheep tightly, tears of happiness streaming down her face.

For many years, Greta kept her promise to Frau Holle. She would return to the Enchanted Forest every year on Frau Holle's birthday, bringing gifts from her heart. She would bring flowers, fruits, and even handmade toys for the forest creatures.

But one year, Greta could not keep her promise. She was sick, and the journey to the Enchanted Forest was too dangerous. She sent her apologies to Frau Holle, promising to make it up to her the following year.

Frau Holle was understanding, but Greta could sense a change in her. She felt a chill in the air whenever she thought of the Enchanted Forest, and she could no longer hear the whispers of the trees.

The next year, Greta tried to make amends, but it was too late. Frau Holle's birthday came and went, and Greta did not appear. Frau Holle was furious, and she cast a spell on Greta, turning her into a stone statue.

The villagers found Greta the following day, a lifeless statue in the heart of the Black Forest. They mourned her loss, but they could not understand why such a kind and gentle soul had been punished.

To this day, Greta's statue stands in the heart of the Black Forest, a reminder of the power of broken promises. The Enchanted Forest is no more, swallowed by the shadows of the Black Forest, and the villagers of Schwarzwald tell the tale of Greta, the girl who broke her promise to Frau Holle.

","Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between the rolling hills of the Black Forest, there lived an old woman named Frau Holle. She was known far and wide for her magical powers, and many a desperate soul had sought her help.

One day, a young girl named Elise found herself in dire straits. Her father had lost his job, and the family was on the brink of starvation. Elise, who was both clever and resourceful, had an idea. She would seek out Frau Holle and ask for her help.

With a heavy heart, Elise set off on her journey. She walked for days, following the winding roads and the meandering streams, until she finally reached the foot of the mountain where Frau Holle lived.

The old woman's house was a strange and wondrous sight. It was made of twigs and vines, and it seemed to change shape and size as Elise approached. As she knocked on the door, it swung open, revealing Frau Holle herself.

""Welcome, child,"" said the old woman, her eyes twinkling with kindness. ""What brings you to my doorstep?""

Elise explained her situation, and Frau Holle listened with a sympathetic ear. ""I will help you,"" she said at last. ""But you must promise to do as I say, no matter how strange it may seem.""

Elise agreed, and Frau Holle led her into the house. Inside, the walls were covered in strange symbols and runes, and the air was thick with magic. Frau Holle took Elise to a room filled with baskets, each one containing a different type of grain.

""Choose one,"" said Frau Holle, ""and I will fill your family's larder with enough food to last a year.""

Elise hesitated, unsure which basket to choose. But then she remembered a story her mother had told her about a magical grain that could never run out. She pointed to a small, unassuming basket, and Frau Holle nodded.

""Very good,"" she said. ""Now, I must warn you, the journey back will not be easy. You must climb the mountain and jump into the clouds. But do not be afraid, for I will be with you every step of the way.""

Elise nodded, determined to complete her task. She followed Frau Holle outside, where the old woman pointed to a steep, rocky path that led up the mountain.

""Go now, and may the gods be with you,"" said Frau Holle.

Elise began to climb, her heart pounding in her chest. The path was treacherous, and she slipped and slid, but she refused to give up. Finally, she reached the top, and she looked out over the clouds below.

""Jump,"" said a voice, and Elise hesitated. But then she remembered her family, and she took a deep breath. She closed her eyes and leapt.

For what felt like an eternity, Elise fell through the clouds, her heart racing with fear. But then she felt a gentle hand on her back, and she was lifted up and carried through the sky.

""Open your eyes,"" said Frau Holle, and Elise did. She found herself standing in a beautiful meadow, surrounded by fields of the magical grain she had chosen.

""Take as much as you need,"" said Frau Holle, ""and when you are finished, I will take you back home.""

Elise filled her baskets with grain, and when they were full, Frau Holle led her back to the mountain. They climbed down together, and when they reached the bottom, Elise thanked the old woman for her help.

""You are welcome,"" said Frau Holle. ""But remember, the magic grain will only work if you share it with others. If you hoard it for yourself, it will lose its power.""

Elise nodded, understanding the old woman's words. She returned home, and her family was overjoyed to see her. They ate and laughed and sang, and for the first time in a long time, they felt truly happy.

And so, Elise's story spread throughout the land, and many a desperate soul sought out Frau Holle's help. But Elise never forgot the old woman's warning, and she shared her grain with all who needed it.

","Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between the rolling hills of Bavaria, there lived a humble shoemaker named Hans. He was known throughout the land for his exceptional craftsmanship, and his shoes were sought after by all. However, Hans was not content with his life. He yearned for something more, something extraordinary.

One day, as Hans was working on a pair of boots, a strange old man appeared at his door. He was dressed in tattered clothes and had a long, unkempt beard. Hans, being a kind-hearted man, offered the old man a seat by the fire and some warm milk.

""I have heard of your skills, young shoemaker,"" the old man said, his voice hoarse. ""I have a task for you, one that requires your unique talents.""

Hans listened intently as the old man spoke of a magical pair of shoes that could take him to the Land of the Giants. In this land, there was a golden goose that laid golden eggs. The old man claimed that if Hans could retrieve the goose, he would be rewarded with unimaginable wealth.

Hans hesitated, unsure if he should believe the old man's tale. But the thought of wealth and adventure was too tempting to resist. He agreed to the task and set off on his journey the next day.

The journey was long and arduous, but Hans persevered. He crossed rivers, climbed mountains, and braved treacherous forests. After many days, he finally arrived at the Land of the Giants.

The giants were massive, towering over Hans like trees. They roamed the land, causing destruction and chaos wherever they went. Hans hid in fear, unsure of how he could possibly retrieve the golden goose.

One day, as Hans was hiding in a thicket, he overheard the giants discussing the golden goose. They spoke of a hidden cave where the goose was kept. Hans' heart raced with excitement. He knew this was his chance.

Under the cover of darkness, Hans crept towards the cave. He could hear the golden goose clucking softly inside. With a deep breath, he pushed open the cave door and stepped inside.

The cave was dark and damp, but Hans could make out the golden goose in the corner. He approached slowly, not wanting to startle the bird. As he reached out to grab the goose, a sudden noise startled him. He turned to see a giant looming over him, a menacing grin on his face.

Hans' heart pounded in his chest as the giant reached for him. But just as the giant's hand was about to touch him, a bright light filled the cave. The giant squinted, trying to see the source of the light.

Suddenly, the old man appeared, his eyes glowing with a strange, otherworldly light. The giant recoiled in fear, backing away slowly. The old man spoke in a voice that echoed through the cave, commanding the giant to leave Hans alone.

The giant, terrified, obeyed the old man and fled the cave. Hans, still shaking, thanked the old man for his help. The old man smiled, telling Hans that he had been watching over him the entire time.

With the golden goose in hand, Hans made his way back to the village. The old man accompanied him, ensuring he made it home safely. When they arrived, Hans was greeted with cheers and applause. He had become a hero, the man who had brought back the golden goose.

Hans lived the rest of his days in wealth and happiness. He never forgot the old man who had helped him on his journey, and he often wondered if the Land of the Giants still existed. But no matter where he went, he always remembered the adventure that had changed his life.

","Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between the towering Black Forest, there lived an old woman named Frau Holle. She was known far and wide for her magical powers, and many a traveler sought her help when they found themselves in trouble.

One day, a young girl named Elise wandered into the forest, lost and afraid. As night fell, she stumbled upon a small, cozy cottage. The door creaked open, and she found herself in the presence of Frau Holle.

""Why have you come to my home, child?"" the old woman asked.

""I am lost, Frau Holle,"" Elise replied, tears streaming down her face. ""I cannot find my way back to my village.""

Frau Holle looked at the girl with kindness in her eyes. ""Do not worry, child. I will help you. But you must do me a favor in return.""

Elise agreed, and Frau Holle told her to gather all the nails that lay scattered throughout the Black Forest. ""It will take you many days, but when you have gathered them all, bring them back to me, and I will show you the way home.""

Elise set off the next morning, armed with a small sack and a determination to complete her task. She spent days and nights searching the forest, her sack growing heavier with each nail she found.

One day, as she was making her way through the dense woods, she came across a group of dwarves. They were busy at work, hammering away at a large anvil.

""Good day, little one,"" one of the dwarves said, noticing Elise. ""What brings you to our forest?""

Elise told them of her mission and asked if they knew of any more nails that she could collect. The dwarves laughed. ""We are blacksmiths, child. We make the nails you seek. If you bring us some iron, we will make as many as you need.""

Elise was overjoyed. She returned to Frau Holle and told her of her discovery. The old woman was pleased and sent Elise back to the dwarves with a large sack of iron.

For weeks, Elise returned to the dwarves, exchanging iron for nails. Finally, her sack was full, and she brought it back to Frau Holle.

The old woman took the sack and counted the nails. ""You have done well, child,"" she said. ""Now, I will show you the way home.""

Frau Holle led Elise through the forest, and before long, they arrived at the edge of the village. Elise thanked the old woman and ran to her home, where she was greeted with open arms.

From that day on, Elise was known as the girl who found the lost nails of the Black Forest. And whenever someone was lost in the woods, they would remember the story of Elise and Frau Holle, and they would know that they were never truly alone.
