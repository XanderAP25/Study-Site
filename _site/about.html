<p>It is I, the creator of this site.</p>

<p>I am Alex. Web design is my passion.</p>

<p>The only information I am willing to share here is what my top twenty-five favorite games are. If that’s okay with you, then keep reading. Otherwise, go back to <a href="/">the home page</a> or something idc.</p>

<p>I used <a href="https://topsters.org">Topsters 3</a> to make this list, and it had 25 spots to fill.</p>

<p>For a gamer like me, that isn’t <strong>that many</strong> of spots to fill. The <strong>idea</strong> is that each row isn’t ordered, but to <em>make</em> it into the row, the game has to be in that tier.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So, a game in the same row isn’t necessarily better than the other games in the row, but it is better than the games in rows below it.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(this is me seeing what a blockquote looks like)</p>
  </blockquote>

<p>Anyway, here’s the list:</p>
