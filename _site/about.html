<p><img src="assets/images/garfel and me.jpg" style="width:200px; height;200px; float:right; padding:10px" />
I’m Alex Puskaric, a Computing &amp; Information Studies graduate from Washington &amp; Jefferson College, who conducted an independent study on large language models. This site is the hub for my research, notebooks, and any content I created along the way.</p>

<p>I also have minors in German and Mathematics; the German minor inspired the folklore case study you’ll find here. I was also a four year member of the college’s track and field team, and am proud to say that I ended my track career as a slightly above average D3 runner.</p>

<p>Outside of my studies and athletics, I enjoy playing video games and reading. I’m currently playing Metaphor: ReFantazio, and have just finished reading a medieval horror novel called <em>Between Two Fires</em>.</p>

<h1 id="about-this-study">About This Study</h1>

<p>During my time in school, I developed an interest in numbers and data, and the insights and relationships that one could find when taking the time to analyze them. Hence my emphasis in data science. Pursuing a study in AI is the natural next step here, as at its core, AI is about understanding data and the relationships between the numbers. As a simple explanation for what AI is, that works, but I have found that it is so much more than that. It is with this study that I hope to not only understand this complex field, but to also distill into a more easily digestible form for others to use as a starting point for their own journeys into AI.</p>

<p>Below, you will find the initial pitch that set the foundation for this study.</p>

<h3 id="the-proposal">The Proposal</h3>

<p>Artificial intelligence is a long existing field of computer science that has made great strides in recent years. This progress has led to the transformation of many industries, such as commerce, healthcare, and tech. Its expansion into people’s lives, and creative fields, has also led to widespread debate on the ethics of its use and the implications of its widespread adoption. As AI continues to evolve, it is evident that its influence will be felt in every corner of the world.</p>

<p>As a topic of study for me personally, there are gaps in my existing knowledge that it can fill. My emphasis in Data Science has imparted onto me some machine learning principles, knowledge on building simulations, and statistical concepts. These are all well and good, but the gap that I seek to address with this study specifically, is generative AI and the more advanced applications of machine learning. Currently, a class does exist for AI already, but it is intended as an introduction, and will not reach the same heights or topics that are proposed in this document. This study will also allow me to apply and further my knowledge of the German language and culture, affording me a chance to carry out a cross-disciplinary study, and to make use of my CIS major and German minor.</p>

<p>Generative AI is specifically interesting to me due to the unique opportunities it has for analysis of the German language and culture via the output of the AI. An initial project for this study could take the form of applying the concepts of linguistics and artificial intelligence to create an English to German translator AI. An example of a larger project could involve taking Grimms’ Fairy Tales, a popular collection of Germanic fairy tales, and training a generative AI model on them. With this model, I could then generate new tales that are intended to follow similar themes and story structure to those found in the original set of fairy tales. Another possible route is taking these Germanic tales, which are known for their darker themes and tone, and generating new versions of them with different tones. The reverse could also theoretically be done, where the darker tone of Grimms’ Fairy Tales is imparted onto other, happier stories. There are many paths that I could follow for just this one project.</p>

<p>Aside from the fascinating outcomes of this study, the habits and lessons it can impart on me might be its most valuable aspect. In the computer science field, one’s education is not finished after you graduate. Technology is constantly evolving, and to remain competitive and competent, it is imperative to remain up to the date on the latest practices and trends. There will always be documentation and research papers that will be on my reading list. Having a study that will force me to not only read up on a topic that is almost completely new to me, but also find valid and competent material to bolster my studies will impart habits that I will carry with me going into my career all the way through to retirement. At the end of the day, what I learn in this study is liable to become outdated in just five years, but that drive and ability to teach myself highly advanced concepts will never age out of relevance.</p>
