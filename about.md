# About Me

<img src="assets/images/garfel and me.jpg" style="width:200px; height;200px; float:right; padding:10px">
I said this already, but my name is Alex Puskaric, and I'm a senior at Washington & Jefferson College. I'm majoring in Computing & Information Studies with an emphasis in Data Science, and minoring in Math and German. I'm also part of the college's track and field team, and have been an active member for all four years of my enrollment.

Outside of my studies and athletics, I enjoy playing video games and reading. I'm currently playing Drakengard for PS2, and have been keeping up with a web-serial called Super Supportive as new chapters come out.

# About This Study

During my time in school, I developed an interest in numbers and data, and the insights and relationships that one could find when taking the time to analyze them. Hence my emphasis in data science. Pursuing a study in AI is the natural next step here, as at its core, AI is about understanding data and the relationships between the numbers. As a simple explanation for what AI is, that works, but I have found that it is so much more than that. It is with this study that I hope to not only understand this complex field, but to also distill into a more easily digestible form for others to use as a starting point for their own journeys into AI.
