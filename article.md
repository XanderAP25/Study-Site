# Demystifiying AI: A Guide to LLMs

Depending on who you are, and your interests, different things likely come to mind when you hear "AI". Maybe you think of Skynet from *Terminator*, J.A.R.V.I.S from *Iron Man*, or Cortana from *Halo*. Or perhaps your mind jumps to AI assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Bixby, or the recommendation algorithms on Netflix and YouTube (less likely, but still possible). More generally, AI models like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok are probably going to be at the front of your mind. Like magic, these powerful tools were seemingly conjured from nothing and showed themselves to be powerful tools. They can read papers for you, write stories and programs, and are now showing themselves to be capable of logically thinking through problems. Impressive? Absolutely. But not magic.

With some time and effort, you can not only come to understand how AI works, but how to make it work for you. It is with that purpose that this guide exists, to distill the dense and scattered information that is out there on AI into a more concise and easily digestible form.
