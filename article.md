## Introduction to AI and LLMs

Before we explore artificial intelligence, let's briefly consider what intelligence itself is. Intelligence is granted to us by the feat of evolution that is our brain. So, what can we do with our brains? We can analyze information, learn from experience, reason through problems, and make decisions. Artificial intelligence is the ability of a machine to perform tasks that require human intelligence. There are many models that can fuel artificial intelligence, and we will get into the algorithms and structures behind these models later in the article.

A simple example of a model is linear regression analysis, which works by feeding data into the model as training data—predictors and a target outcome. Based on the training data, the model learns the relationships between the predictors and target variables, allowing it to make predictions.

A more advanced example of a machine learning system is the neural network, which draws inspiration from the neurons in our brains. Like biological neurons, artificial neurons receive input, process it, and pass it along “synapses” to other neurons until an output is eventually produced ([^1]). This "input to neuron to output" structure is repeated over and over, sometimes hundreds of thousands of times, just as signals travel through the human brain to form thoughts or trigger physical responses.

As shown above, artificial neural networks mimic this process using layers of artificial neurons, or nodes, that process incoming data using mathematical functions. One common function is the sigmoid function ([^2]), which normalizes the input value into a range between 0 and 1, allowing the model to determine whether or not to "activate" a connection. Each node in a layer processes its input and passes its result to the next layer, continuing until a final output is produced.

The bulk of this processing happens in the layers between input and output, or the hidden layers, where data is transformed multiple times before a final decision is made ([^1]). Whether a node passes its output to another is determined by weights—numerical values that represent the strength of the connection between two nodes. These weights are learned during training. For example, a neural network could be trained to identify whether an image depicts an apple or an orange. During training, the network is fed tons of labeled images of apples and oranges. As it processes the images, the weights between nodes are adjusted to recognize the features unique to the fruits. Once trained, this network can classify a new input image as either an apple or an orange based on the features it observed from the training data.

There are many types of neural networks, each developed to tackle increasingly complex and demanding AI tasks. One notable predecessor to today’s most advanced models is the recurrent neural network (RNN), which was once the standard for handling sequential data ([^3]). While we won’t cover RNNs in detail here, it’s useful to understand their limitations, especially because they set the stage for the development of a more powerful alternative: the Transformer model. This architecture is the foundation of many modern AI systems, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT.

Before we can get into the Transformer architecture, it's worth understanding why it replaced RNNs. In a standard neural network, information flows in one direction, from input to output, with no memory of previous inputs. This becomes a major obstacle when dealing with sequential data like text, where context is key. RNNs addressed this by introducing loops that allowed the network to maintain a form of memory, but they struggled with long-term dependencies. For example, when processing the sentence:

**"I love Rad Cat for his academic due diligence and intellect."**

The RNN takes each word as input, one at a time, and treats it as largely independent from the words that came before. When it starts with "I," it has no memory of what’s coming next. If the task were to predict the next word, the network would have to make a guess based solely on "I," without any understanding of the sentence’s broader context. This is a difficult task even for a human, let alone a machine. To handle this, RNNs introduce a loop in their architecture that allows each output to be fed back in as an input, enabling the model to retain information about earlier words as it moves through the sequence. This gives the network a rudimentary memory, so by the time it reaches "intellect," it can recall the presence of "academic" earlier in the sentence and use that relationship to inform its output.

The issue with this method, however, lies in its inefficiency and limited memory. RNNs must process sequences step by step, and as the sequence grows longer, their ability to retain earlier information diminishes. For short sentences like the one above, the memory may hold up well enough, but for longer, more complex sequences, earlier words are often “forgotten” as the network progresses ([^3]). This makes it hard for RNNs to recognize and leverage long-range relationships in text, which are often crucial for understanding nuance, tone, or reference.

The solution to this problem was an entirely new architecture for processing information: the Transformer architecture. The most important concept to understand for the Transformer model is the idea of attention, which is covered at length in *Attention is All You Need* ([^3]).

<img src="assets/images/transformer diagram.png" style="width:300px; height:180px;">
<span style="font-family:Arial; font-size:xx-small;">Illustration of the Transformer architecture ([^3]).</span>

Self-attention is a mechanism that allows a model to look at every word in a sequence at the same time and decide how much attention it should pay to each word in relation to the others ([^3]). This is incredibly helpful when reading sentences because the model can find relationships between words, even if they are far apart. For example, let's look at "I love Rad Cat for his academic due diligence and intellect" again. A self-attention mechanism will process the entire sequence and assign a weight to every pair of words. The mechanism can see that "Rad" has a stronger connection to "Cat" over "love," so the weight will be greater and prioritized when making predictions.

At first glance, this might sound similar to how RNNs process sequences. The key difference is the ability for the self-attention mechanism to consider all words of a sequence at once, as opposed to sequentially reading through it. This removes the performance bottleneck of processing words one by one and also addresses the memory limitations of RNNs that cause them to forget relationships between words separated over a long distance.

Now, there is a limitation with self-attention mechanisms. Instead of just running one self-attention mechanism on the model, multi-head attention runs multiple self-attention mechanisms in parallel with each other. Each mechanism, or head, looks at the sequence from a different perspective and finds different relationships between the words of the sequence. A single self-attention mechanism might only find the relationship between "Rad" and "Cat," while another could find the relationship between "love" and "intellect."

This is enabled by the encoding of the words in the input sequence into a numerical representation, called an embedding, which captures the relationships it has with other words in the sequence. This encoding is split up into a number of smaller sections for each head to focus on. At the end of multi-head attention, these relationships are all added back together, leading to a more complete understanding of the input sequence and a much better ability for predicting the next word in a sequence ([^3]). At a high level, that is how the Transformer model works. It makes use of multi-head attention to look at a sequence from different perspectives to get a more complete understanding of the relationships between the words than it would have had with just a single attention mechanism or through an RNN. For anyone curious about what the actual implementation of this architecture looks like, there are videos out there on that topic ([^4]).

The Transformer model powers modern AI and enables many of the incredible applications we see today. AI is used to translate languages, analyze vast amounts of information to generate summaries, recognize and classify images, create realistic images and videos, and much more. One of the most well-known applications of AI is text generation, where models process a prompt and generate a relevant response. These models, known as Large Language Models (LLMs), specialize in understanding and producing human-like text. Some of the applications mentioned earlier, like text summarization and language translation, also fall under this label. For the rest of this article, we will focus on LLMs, exploring how they work, their benefits, and how you can use them effectively.

## How LLMs Can Benefit You and Their Challenges

At their core, LLMs process text and generate relevant responses. This is a simplified explanation of how LLMs function, but it should make clear the potential that such technology holds. Imagine having an assistant that can instantly summarize an article or a peer to help brainstorm solutions to complex technical problems. What LLMs have to offer is nothing short of revolutionary, but they are not without their downsides. Like any computer program, LLMs require compute power — and lots of it. There are significant environmental concerns (which we will look at later in this section) that humanity must confront if we continue to use this technology. There are also many difficult ethical questions and concerns that must be addressed, or at the very least acknowledged, to not only inform your use of this technology but to decide if AI is truly a net good.

For both everyday users and professionals, there is some way in which LLMs can make a tangible impact. Imagine a chatbot that can answer questions you might have on a topic of interest or study, help troubleshoot tech issues, or act as a proofreader to quickly smooth out your writing. If you are considering a project of any kind, an LLM can work as a sounding board to help identify angles of approach or ideas you haven't yet considered. In the professional space, management consultants at Boston Consulting Group have been found to complete tasks 25.1% quicker with 40% better quality in their output just by adopting LLMs into their workflow ([^5]). Now, imagine applying that to your own workflow — writing reports, coding, or even managing emails. The potential efficiency gains could be substantial. Granted, this is just one case study for a consulting firm, and your personal philosophy on work or your workflow may not mesh as well with AI. Yet, it still stands as an example of the power of AI when it integrates well with a user base and workflow.

In education, LLMs are transforming how we teach and learn. Think about the time-consuming tasks teachers face daily: creating assessments, developing lesson plans, providing individualized feedback. LLMs have the potential to handle all of these efficiently. These tools can develop personalized learning materials like summaries, flashcards, and quizzes tailored to individual students ([^6]). One study even makes the bold claim that LLMs can make grading more consistent and fair by reducing the subjective biases that naturally creep into human assessment ([^7]). There are implications here for the personal role of teachers in education and how LLMs can potentially hamper it that should be considered before deciding if this is truly a positive change in the education space. For example, LLMs can give individualized feedback, but should they be the ones doing it instead of the human teacher? The AI can learn the quirks, failings, and proficiencies of a student and tailor its feedback in a robust emulation of human feedback, but is that worth as much as a teacher's feedback if it is approved by them and saves them time for other teaching duties? Beyond the potential of saving time, LLMs offer powerful language support for students who may not know the native language used in the classroom. What could be most valuable is how using LLMs in classrooms now prepares students for the future AI-driven workforce. As students learn to craft effective prompts through trial and error, they're building critical thinking skills and technological literacy that will serve them regardless of which careers emerge in our AI-integrated future.

The benefits of LLMs aren't just limited to any one field or person; they're already reshaping our world in unexpected ways. For example, in healthcare, there have been major strides in drug discovery and molecular synthesis with AI models as the key drivers. Insilico is a biotechnology company that has previously used generative AI to develop a drug that is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials ([^8]). Although the drug was developed using generative AI rather than an LLM, their new LLM-powered system called Nach0 is capable of designing molecules, predicting their properties, and even suggesting synthesis methods ([^8]). While no Nach0-designed drugs have entered clinical trials yet, there is a possibility that the drugs of the future are designed using AI models that are built upon the LLMs you use today.

While there is a lot of good that LLMs can do for you and the world at large, they are clearly not a miracle technology with zero drawbacks. There is nuance to their use, and many of their benefits are still in the early stages or not fully realized yet. One of the most controversial downsides to their very existence is how their training data is obtained and used. We'll be covering this more extensively in the following sections, but LLMs need vast amounts of data to get as competent as they've become today. An easy way to get this data is to scrape the entire internet. The owners and creators of digital content are typically not asked for their consent when their material is used to train AI systems, and this has led to extensive debate on the ethical and legal ramifications of training AI. Currently, there is no law against scraping data from the web and using it to train models, but some organizations like *The New York Times* have moved forward with lawsuits against both OpenAI and Microsoft over the use of their copyrighted content to train their models ([^9]). This raises an ethical dilemma: should AI companies profit from models trained on content they don't own? Opponents, like *The New York Times* in their lawsuit, argue that it disregards creators' rights and exploits their work without compensation. Proponents counter that broad data scraping is essential for AI advancement and the benefits it brings, essentially saying that accurate and higher-quality outputs justify any infringement on intellectual property that may occur.

You might have also wondered how broad sections of the internet are prepared for AI training. It's not as simple as dumping raw web pages into an algorithm to train a model. Data needs to be cleaned, filtered, and categorized. Since algorithms aren't perfect at identifying harmful or low-quality content, much of this work falls on human moderators. These workers, often from lower-income countries, are tasked with reviewing massive amounts of disturbing material containing graphic violence, hate speech, and child exploitation, all to keep AI models "safe" for users. The psychological toll of this work is severe, with many moderators reporting trauma and PTSD-like symptoms from prolonged exposure ([^10]). Yet, these workers remain largely invisible, underpaid, and unprotected, raising serious ethical concerns about the unseen labor behind AI advancements. The research paper *On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots* covers many of these downsides at length, and while I will continue to draw from it when covering the downsides of AI, I urge anyone with an interest in AI to read through the 10-page paper ([^10]).

Beyond data processing, LLMs also struggle with transparency. Most training datasets are poorly documented, making it difficult to track biases, misinformation, or potential harm ([^10]). Even today, many popular models on Hugging Face do not disclose their training data well. This lack of accountability disproportionately affects marginalized groups, as AI models trained on biased data tend to reinforce existing inequalities. From racial and gender biases in generated text to the erasure of underrepresented dialects and cultures, LLMs have the potential to reflect and amplify the flaws of the data they consume ([^10]). We've seen an example of the impact unchecked training data can have with the case of the Twitter chatbot Tay, which was designed to learn based on its interactions with users. Within 24 hours, the bot was shut down after it started spouting hateful rhetoric that it learned from the website ([^15]).

Compounding the potential for bias and hatred is the environmental cost. Training and running large AI models require immense computational power, consuming as much energy as entire cities ([^10]). Even simple queries to ChatGPT consume far more energy than what is required for a Google search. As AI development accelerates, so does its carbon footprint, raising concerns about sustainability and the long-term impact on our planet. We were already facing climate challenges prior to the explosion of AI's popularity, and regardless of the benefits they may bring, the harm they will inflict on our planet is undoubtedly one of the biggest obstacles to widespread adoption and acceptance.

Access to LLMs is also not universal. Many people, especially in lower-income regions, are excluded from their benefits due to infrastructure limitations, language barriers, or financial costs ([^10]). Yet, these same communities often bear the brunt of AI's environmental impact, as the energy-intensive data centers powering these models contribute to climate change and resource consumption that disproportionately affect marginalized populations ([^10]). This imbalance raises questions about who truly benefits from AI advancements and who is left dealing with the consequences.

AI is a revolutionary technology that can massively improve your workflow, education, and potentially lead to the rapid creation of drugs for diseases we have not yet found cures for. But its development has relied on ethically questionable practices, from exploitative labor to environmental harm. Anyone using it extensively should reflect on whether they're comfortable with these trade-offs. It's an uncomfortable but necessary conversation — one that, by acknowledging AI's downsides, can push us toward a future where these issues are meaningfully addressed.

## Making LLMs Work for You

When it comes to making LLMs work for you, there are two main methods. The first we will cover is accessing LLMs via APIs.

An LLM API lets you connect your computer directly to ultra-powerful AI models, like GPT-4 and Llama 2, without having to download and run the model on your own machine. What this means for you is that regardless of your hardware, as long as you have a Wi-Fi connection and the ability to pay the fee to access the model, you have an LLM that you can use and modify to your heart's content. The fee to use these APIs is often not a monthly subscription but instead a fee per million tokens processed as input and output. This practice has become the standard across most AI companies, but some AIs, like Mistral, offer monthly subscriptions. For reference, one token is about four characters, or roughly three-fourths of a word. This fee depends on the model you're paying to access but can range from \$30 per million tokens processed as output for OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo model to \$2.00 per million tokens processed as output for their smaller GPT-3.5 Turbo model. Prices vary depending on the company and model, but there will typically be a price associated with using these larger models.

The cost of using these models presents some concerns when you're just starting out. For example, what constitutes a heavy workload for these models? You could be getting acquainted with your shiny new LLM and suddenly find yourself paying way more than you initially intended because you didn’t realize that the multi-hour conversation or learning session you had required millions of input and output tokens to be processed. There are also privacy concerns associated with using LLM APIs, as they typically store your prompts and outputs to improve their technology. This data is also used to enforce the company’s TOS, prevent illegal activity, and, in specific circumstances, may be shared with other parties ([^14]). Those circumstances include requests from government authorities, disclosures to certain service providers and vendors when business needs must be met, and during diligence processes involving business transfers ([^14]). Since user data is retained, this also raises the risk of your data being exposed in a data breach if the company that provides your LLM is hacked.

Despite these concerns, LLM APIs are typically at the cutting edge of AI technology. So if you're looking for the most powerful model for a specific application, using an API might be the right choice.

If relying on an external API doesn't suit your needs or priorities, an alternative approach is to run an LLM directly on your own computer. Running LLMs locally gives you more control over your data, as it remains entirely on your device and is never shared with the model's creator. There are also no fees for running a local LLM, aside from a possible increase in your electricity bill if you run them for extended periods. While this might sound ideal, there are several caveats to consider. For one, these models require fairly powerful hardware to run efficiently. Although there is no fee to use a local LLM, you will likely need to invest in a powerful PC to get the most out of the technology. Smaller models can run on more modest hardware, such as a relatively modern laptop, but you'll likely experience slower output and lower quality compared to running top-tier models on a high-performance PC with a strong NVIDIA GPU. There are also smaller quantized versions of larger LLMs that offer high-quality output while being able to run on less powerful hardware ([^19]).

To get an LLM up and running on your own machine, you will need a platform to run it. One of the most popular platforms for this purpose is [Ollama](https://ollama.com), an open-source tool that allows you to run AI models that you have downloaded through a terminal. Setup is fairly straightforward—just download the application from the website and follow the steps to get up and running. The Ollama website hosts models for immediate use, but you can also run community models from Hugging Face or custom models of your own design if there is a specific LLM better suited to your needs. Other than Ollama, [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) is a similar application that provides a graphical interface for interacting with your AI models instead of a terminal-based approach like Ollama. There are also web-based frontends for Ollama that you can set up, but they require some technical knowledge, which I will not be covering here ([^20]).

Another popular option for running local models is [GPT4All](https://www.nomic.ai/gpt4all). It stands out for its user-friendliness, offering a clean, ChatGPT-like interface. Unlike platforms like Ollama, which rely on terminal commands, GPT4All is more plug-and-play. Once installed, it allows you to easily browse and download models directly within the application, requiring no additional repositories or command-line interactions. GPT4All also lists the RAM requirements for its models, which is incredibly helpful when deciding which model to use.

AI models are measured by the number of parameters they have, formatted like "8B," meaning 8 billion parameters in this case. For everyday computers like laptops, you will want to use models that are at most 8B. Depending on how powerful your laptop is, you could go higher than that, especially if it has a dedicated NVIDIA GPU. For desktop PCs with powerful GPUs, you can go higher but will typically find a limit around the 30B parameter mark. Despite that, there are models available for download with upwards of 70B parameters, extending into the hundreds of billions.

To run those massive models, you would either need to invest in a high-end rig dedicated to AI processing or purchase access to a cloud computing service and use their hardware instead. In a way, this is the middle ground between running an LLM on your own computer and using an API to access a company's AI model. You gain some of the benefits of local LLMs, such as data privacy and model flexibility, while also enjoying the power and scalability of cloud-based models. You do have to pay to use these cloud services, but the rates are hourly instead of usage-based, which could be good or bad depending on your workflow.

In my case, where I wanted to not only generate stories but also fine-tune a model (which we will cover in the next section), I opted to purchase compute units from Google to use with their Google Colab notebook environment. This granted me access to an incredibly powerful GPU, allowing me to generate stories at a far faster rate than on my local machine while also enabling easy sharing of my code since it was hosted online. For most introductory AI applications, I would recommend Google Colab, as there is a free tier that allows experimentation with more powerful models than most consumer-grade machines can handle.

Ultimately, your choice of interface and machine when using an LLM will be based on your needs and preferences. If you just want a private chatbot that lacks the usage limits of free-tier AI models like ChatGPT, then Ollama, LM Studio, or GPT4All will likely suit your needs, assuming your machine can run smaller or quantized models. If you are looking into tuning or training your own LLM or using a top-of-the-line LLM with no compromises, then an API or cloud computing solution will be more suited to your workflow. Just ensure you do your due diligence in selecting an API or solution that best fits your needs.

## Training and Fine-Tuning an LLM
We briefly covered how models are trained in the first section, but let's recap. During training, models process massive sequences of text, analyzing how words relate to one another within a given context. By identifying these relationships, the model learns to predict and generate coherent text based on patterns in its training data. These pre-trained LLMs are what most people will work with when setting up their own specialized LLM, largely because not everyone has the ability to dedicate unfathomable amounts of energy toward training their ideal model. This is where in-context learning (ICL) and fine-tuning come into play.

Both of these techniques influence the LLM's output, but they operate in fundamentally different ways. Fine-tuning involves retraining the model itself on new data, altering its parameters. In-context learning does not require any tweaks to the model's parameters for it to specialize in the task at hand. Instead, you provide the model with examples, and it learns dynamically as you educate it on the desired topic ([^11]). This approach is particularly useful for tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, or language translation since you can supply examples for the AI to follow, allowing it to learn how to complete the tasks.  

Let's take sentiment analysis as an example. Suppose you want your LLM to determine whether a movie review is positive or negative. To do this, you provide a set of demonstration examples within a prompt:  

|Prompt|  
|------|  
|Answer the upcoming prompts using this format: <br>Review: This movie was nothing but a waste of my time and money. I'm done with this franchise. Sentiment: Negative<br>Review: The ultimate conclusion to a story five years in the making. I am speechless. Sentiment: Positive<br>Review: While the visuals and flashy fights were enough to get me through the movie, I just could not engage with the story. Sentiment: Negative|  

That is all you need for a basic implementation of ICL—just give the LLM an example to follow, and it will adhere to it as best it can. However, there are nuances to this technique that can maximize its effectiveness. Specifically, one must consider the selection of data used in the prompt, the format in which it is presented, and the order in which it is given to the AI ([^11]). We want to provide relevant examples formatted in an accessible manner and ensure they build upon one another logically. Taking time to plan your approach before executing it will lead to better results. For more details on techniques to optimize in-context learning, I recommend reading *A Survey on In-Context Learning* and the sources it references for improved learning practices ([^11]).  

You can see how I used ICL to enhance an LLM's story generation capabilities in my story generation code notebook ([^15]).  

Fine-tuning is more involved than ICL, requiring modification of the model's parameters by training it on new data specialized for the intended function. Since the LLM undergoes retraining, the result is a model that more effectively executes the desired task. The fine-tuning process requires a relevant dataset. If the goal is sentiment analysis, the dataset might resemble the following:  

|Text|Sentiment|  
|----|---------|  
|This movie was nothing but a waste of my time and money. I'm done with this franchise. | Negative|  
|The ultimate conclusion to a story five years in the making. I am speechless. | Positive |  
|While the visuals and flashy fights were enough to get me through the movie, I just could not engage with the story. | Negative |  

In a real-world application, you would need far more than just three reviews, but this serves as an example of the type of data provided for fine-tuning.  

From here, the model’s parameters are adjusted based on the dataset, ingraining an understanding of movie review sentiment directly into the model. The key advantage of fine-tuning over ICL is that fine-tuning integrates the new information permanently into the LLM's structure. Just like a person, LLMs "forget" what they learned after a session ends. Instead of feeding an LLM the same prompt every time you want it to complete a specific task, you can fine-tune a model to ensure it remembers how to perform the task consistently.  

You can see how I used a dataset consisting of German fairy tales to fine-tune an LLM in my fine-tuning code notebook ([^16]). If you are interested in comparing the fine-tuned model to a baseline model using ICL, I recommend reviewing my text analysis code notebook ([^17]). If not, just know that fine-tuning in this case led to generated stories that more closely resembled traditional German fairy tales than those produced via ICL. However, this increased accuracy came at a significantly higher cost in terms of efficiency. The stories generated using ICL prompts were still relatively close to the fine-tuned model’s outputs in structure and theme, meaning that, depending on your needs, ICL may be preferable to fine-tuning despite some loss in quality. Fine-tuning is a costly process, and while I discuss it further in my case study notebooks, I encourage you to explore the references below for more details ([^18]).

## Conclusion

In this guide, we explored the Transformer architecture and highlighted how attention mechanisms contribute to the powerful text processing capabilities seen in LLMs. These models offer immense benefits, from enhancing workflows to providing innovative solutions across various fields. However, alongside these advantages come significant environmental, ethical, legal, and moral considerations that must be acknowledged. It’s crucial for anyone looking to harness the potential of AI to understand these challenges and use the technology responsibly.

To make effective use of this technology, it’s important to carefully consider which API, cloud service, or application best suits your use case, while also determining whether in-context learning or fine-tuning is the best approach to tailoring a model to your needs.

With that said, I hope you found something useful from this guide, and I wish you luck in your own AI journey. If you haven't already, I highly recommend checking out my case studies. The code notebooks are a great introduction into how one might use LLMs for their own interests, from fine-tuning a model, to crafting ICL prompts, to generating desired output.

[^18]: LLMs use tons of VRAM, and require powerful GPUs to be used to their fullest extent. Whether that be output generation, or fine-tuning, you want to have a lot of VRAM at your disposal. You can get away with using CPUs or Apple Silicon in conjunction with your system RAM for running and fine-tuning smaller LLMs, but you will see noticeably less performance and efficiency. Google Colab is a relatively cheap resource to rent powerful GPUs that you can easily use for your AI ambitions. You can even use a free T4 GPU, which offers more power than what the layman would likely have on hand. A good rule of thumb is that you want at least 16 GB of VRAM to do anything significant with moderate sized LLMs (1-3B parameters), and you may want 80GB+ of VRAM if you're fine-tuning larger models.

[^19]: Quantized models have their weights reduced in size from (typically) 32-bit floats to 8-bit integers. This significantly reduces their size and computational overhead while making them less precise in their outputs, meaning that they will have somewhat lower quality generated text. These models still benefit from large training sets and expert optimization, however.

[^20]: Any web-based frontend for Ollama will require [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/)  to be installed onto your machine. I recommend having some knowledge of Docker if you're at all interested in software development, so this could be a good introduction to that tool. This front-end is a popular choice for users of Ollama: https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui
