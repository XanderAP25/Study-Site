# Demystifying AI: A Guide to LLMs

Depending on who you are, and your interests, different things likely come to mind when you hear "AI". Maybe you think of Skynet from *Terminator*, J.A.R.V.I.S from *Iron Man*, or Cortana from *Halo*. Or perhaps your mind jumps to AI assistants like Siri, Alexa, or Bixby, or the recommendation algorithms on Netflix and YouTube (less likely, but still possible). More generally, AI models like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude are probably going to be at the front of your mind. Like magic, these powerful tools were seemingly conjured from nothing and showed themselves to be incredibly useful. They can read papers for you, write stories and code, and are now seemingly able to reason through problems with the introduction of reasoning models. Impressive? Absolutely. But not magic.

This website is a distillation of the dense of the scattered information that is out there on AI. Below, you will find links to the sections of an article that I wrote on the fundamentals of AI, covering how it works, and how you can make Large Language Models (LLMs) work for you. There are some accompanying case studies with code examples that will be referenced in the article, but they should also serve as standalone examples of how one could generate output with an LLM in a programming environment and how to fine-tune a model for your needs.

This website was made with those unfamiliar with the inner workings of artificial intelligence and AI applications in mind. No complex math or programming knowledge is required, but a basic familiarity with coding concepts will help. Even if you're new to AI, the content on this website will give you a solid foundation to build upon.
