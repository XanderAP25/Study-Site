# Code Notebooks

### [Fine-Tuning a Language Model for Story Generation in a Notebook Environment]({{ '/finetune_notebook.html' | relative_url }})

A notebook containing the step-by-step process of loading a model for finetuning, as well as loading pretrained models for story generation.

### [Text Analysis of Output and Grimms]({{ '/text_analysis_notebook.html' | relative_url }})

A notebook walking through the analysis of the output of a pretrained LLM with a baseline prompt, ICL prompt, and a fine-tuned LLM compared with a corpus of Grimm's Fairy Tales. The findings evaluate the models for how closely they get to true fairy tales.
