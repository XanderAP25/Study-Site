## Section Two: How LLMs Can Benefit You and Their Challenges

At their core, LLMs process text and generate relevant responses. This is a simplified explanation of how LLMs function, but it should make clear the potential that such technology holds. Imagine having an assistant that can instantly summarize an article or a peer to help brainstorm solutions to complex technical problems. What LLMs have to offer is nothing short of revolutionary, but they are not without their downsides. Like any computer program, LLMs require compute power — and lots of it. There are significant environmental concerns (which we will look at later in this section) that humanity must confront if we continue to use this technology. There are also many difficult ethical questions and concerns that must be addressed, or at the very least acknowledged, to not only inform your use of this technology but to decide if AI is truly a net good.

For both everyday users and professionals, there is some way in which LLMs can make a tangible impact. Imagine a chatbot that can answer questions you might have on a topic of interest or study, help troubleshoot tech issues, or act as a proofreader to quickly smooth out your writing. If you are considering a project of any kind, an LLM can work as a sounding board to help identify angles of approach or ideas you haven't yet considered. In the professional space, management consultants at Boston Consulting Group have been found to complete tasks 25.1% quicker with 40% better quality in their output just by adopting LLMs into their workflow ([^5]). Now, imagine applying that to your own workflow — writing reports, coding, or even managing emails. The potential efficiency gains could be substantial. Granted, this is just one case study for a consulting firm, and your personal philosophy on work or your workflow may not mesh as well with AI. Yet, it still stands as an example of the power of AI when it integrates well with a user base and workflow.

In education, LLMs are transforming how we teach and learn. Think about the time-consuming tasks teachers face daily: creating assessments, developing lesson plans, providing individualized feedback. LLMs have the potential to handle all of these efficiently. These tools can develop personalized learning materials like summaries, flashcards, and quizzes tailored to individual students ([^6]). One study even makes the bold claim that LLMs can make grading more consistent and fair by reducing the subjective biases that naturally creep into human assessment ([^7]). There are implications here for the personal role of teachers in education and how LLMs can potentially hamper it that should be considered before deciding if this is truly a positive change in the education space. For example, LLMs can give individualized feedback, but should they be the ones doing it instead of the human teacher? The AI can learn the quirks, failings, and proficiencies of a student and tailor its feedback in a robust emulation of human feedback, but is that worth as much as a teacher's feedback if it is approved by them and saves them time for other teaching duties? Beyond the potential of saving time, LLMs offer powerful language support for students who may not know the native language used in the classroom. What could be most valuable is how using LLMs in classrooms now prepares students for the future AI-driven workforce. As students learn to craft effective prompts through trial and error, they're building critical thinking skills and technological literacy that will serve them regardless of which careers emerge in our AI-integrated future.

The benefits of LLMs aren't just limited to any one field or person; they're already reshaping our world in unexpected ways. For example, in healthcare, there have been major strides in drug discovery and molecular synthesis with AI models as the key drivers. Insilico is a biotechnology company that has previously used generative AI to develop a drug that is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials ([^8]). Although the drug was developed using generative AI rather than an LLM, their new LLM-powered system called Nach0 is capable of designing molecules, predicting their properties, and even suggesting synthesis methods ([^8]). While no Nach0-designed drugs have entered clinical trials yet, there is a possibility that the drugs of the future are designed using AI models that are built upon the LLMs you use today.

While there is a lot of good that LLMs can do for you and the world at large, they are clearly not a miracle technology with zero drawbacks. There is nuance to their use, and many of their benefits are still in the early stages or not fully realized yet. One of the most controversial downsides to their very existence is how their training data is obtained and used. We'll be covering this more extensively in the following sections, but LLMs need vast amounts of data to get as competent as they've become today. An easy way to get this data is to scrape the entire internet. The owners and creators of digital content are typically not asked for their consent when their material is used to train AI systems, and this has led to extensive debate on the ethical and legal ramifications of training AI. Currently, there is no law against scraping data from the web and using it to train models, but some organizations like *The New York Times* have moved forward with lawsuits against both OpenAI and Microsoft over the use of their copyrighted content to train their models ([^9]). This raises an ethical dilemma: should AI companies profit from models trained on content they don't own? Opponents, like *The New York Times* in their lawsuit, argue that it disregards creators' rights and exploits their work without compensation. Proponents counter that broad data scraping is essential for AI advancement and the benefits it brings, essentially saying that accurate and higher-quality outputs justify any infringement on intellectual property that may occur.

You might have also wondered how broad sections of the internet are prepared for AI training. It's not as simple as dumping raw web pages into an algorithm to train a model. Data needs to be cleaned, filtered, and categorized. Since algorithms aren't perfect at identifying harmful or low-quality content, much of this work falls on human moderators. These workers, often from lower-income countries, are tasked with reviewing massive amounts of disturbing material containing graphic violence, hate speech, and child exploitation, all to keep AI models "safe" for users. The psychological toll of this work is severe, with many moderators reporting trauma and PTSD-like symptoms from prolonged exposure ([^10]). Yet, these workers remain largely invisible, underpaid, and unprotected, raising serious ethical concerns about the unseen labor behind AI advancements. The research paper *On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots* covers many of these downsides at length, and while I will continue to draw from it when covering the downsides of AI, I urge anyone with an interest in AI to read through the 10-page paper ([^10]).

Beyond data processing, LLMs also struggle with transparency. Most training datasets are poorly documented, making it difficult to track biases, misinformation, or potential harm ([^10]). Even today, many popular models on Hugging Face do not disclose their training data well. This lack of accountability disproportionately affects marginalized groups, as AI models trained on biased data tend to reinforce existing inequalities. From racial and gender biases in generated text to the erasure of underrepresented dialects and cultures, LLMs have the potential to reflect and amplify the flaws of the data they consume ([^10]). We've seen an example of the impact unchecked training data can have with the case of the Twitter chatbot Tay, which was designed to learn based on its interactions with users. Within 24 hours, the bot was shut down after it started spouting hateful rhetoric that it learned from the website ([^15]).

Compounding the potential for bias and hatred is the environmental cost. Training and running large AI models require immense computational power, consuming as much energy as entire cities ([^10]). Even simple queries to ChatGPT consume far more energy than what is required for a Google search. As AI development accelerates, so does its carbon footprint, raising concerns about sustainability and the long-term impact on our planet. We were already facing climate challenges prior to the explosion of AI's popularity, and regardless of the benefits they may bring, the harm they will inflict on our planet is undoubtedly one of the biggest obstacles to widespread adoption and acceptance.

Access to LLMs is also not universal. Many people, especially in lower-income regions, are excluded from their benefits due to infrastructure limitations, language barriers, or financial costs ([^10]). Yet, these same communities often bear the brunt of AI's environmental impact, as the energy-intensive data centers powering these models contribute to climate change and resource consumption that disproportionately affect marginalized populations ([^10]). This imbalance raises questions about who truly benefits from AI advancements and who is left dealing with the consequences.

AI is a revolutionary technology that can massively improve your workflow, education, and potentially lead to the rapid creation of drugs for diseases we have not yet found cures for. But its development has relied on ethically questionable practices, from exploitative labor to environmental harm. Anyone using it extensively should reflect on whether they're comfortable with these trade-offs. It's an uncomfortable but necessary conversation — one that, by acknowledging AI's downsides, can push us toward a future where these issues are meaningfully addressed.
